            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Ere is Life and Death laid down before you, <hi>If ye walk after the fleſh, ye ſhall die:</hi> a dreadful word, ſpoke even to thoſe who are in Chriſt, and to whom there is no Condemnation, who yet need to be warned of their dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. Conditional-threatnings may be muſtered to them, without bringing them back to a ſpirit of bondage; and the Lord works on their fear, as well as on their love and will have them keep one eye on Hell, and another on Heaven: or rather, he'l ſometimes have them look behind them, that at the ſight of Hell and Wrath, they may flye the faſter to the Hope that's ſet before them: do not deceive your ſelves with an opinion of your Priviledges.</p>
            <p>Well then, <hi>What muſt we do that we may be ſaved?</hi> the words of the Text tells you: where mark, that the Apoſtle is ſpeaking to ſuch as are in Chriſt: If ye ask what an unrenewed man ſhould do to be ſaved? the Scripture Anſwers,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:103420:5"/>
               <hi>Believe in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Act. 16. 1 Joh. 3.23. Get into Chriſt. But if ye ask, What the man that is in Chriſt ſhall do? the Text tells you, which takes in, or rather ſuppoſes holy walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or walking after the Spirit; for as light comes in, darkneſs goes out: ſo that Mortification is one part of the Condition upon which we attain the poſſeſſion of eternal Life, though it be by faith, by our firſt believing, that we acquire a right to it.</p>
            <p>Now in the words, we have, 1. The Act en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned, <hi>Mortifie.</hi> 2. The Object about which it is converſant. 3. The way or the means by which this is to be effected, <hi>through the Spirit:</hi> 4. The Promiſe annexed, <hi>Ye ſhall live:</hi> 5. The Conditionality of the Promiſe: <hi>If, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the firſt, What it is, we ſhall after ſhew; only now the Original word ſignifies, to ſlay, to purſue to Death. Sin is not at once ſlain, itgets a deaths-ſtroke, by the firſt ſaving-work of grace: it never recovers that; but yet it dies but lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gringly (therefore called <hi>a Crucifixion);</hi> and its a great part of the Chriſtians work to follow it to death, to be driving nails into it, and keep it bleeding till it expire.</p>
            <p>For the ſecond, Let us obſerve the various Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture-expreſſions: as 1. <hi>Fleſh,</hi> ſo frequently in this Chapter; this ſometimes ſignifies the ſtate of the natural man: <hi>he that is in the fleſh cannot pleaſe God;</hi> ſo <hi>John</hi> 3.6. Sometimes the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of ſin in the Regenerate, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.16. And ſo we read of the works of the fleſh, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.19, theſe are <hi>the deeds of the fleſh.</hi> 2. Sin is ſpoke of as a <hi>body,</hi> as in the Text; ſometimes called <hi>a
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:103420:5"/>body of ſin,</hi> Rom. 6.6. Sometimes, <hi>the body of this death,</hi> Rom. 7.24. It's a Body, not a Phantaſm, we are to conflict with: it's not to <hi>beat the air</hi> we are called to: its weight is not found, becauſe it is in its place, in its Element. Now this Body hath various Members, theſe we are to mortifie: <hi>Col.</hi> 3.5. The ſtump of ſin cannot be got out, but we muſt be daily mutilating it, and cutting off its members: the ſtump we cannot pluck up; the body and maſs of in-dwelling ſin we cannot diſcern, nor reach; but its deeds and workings we feel. And albeit Gods faving-work upon the Soul (wherein we are paſſive) does wound and weaken the Body, ſin: yet any work of grace wherein we are active, does immediately only ſtrike at the members of ſin, and at the deeds of it: therefore ſays the Text, <hi>If,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>mortifie the deeds of the body.</hi> 3. Sin is called <hi>a Man,</hi> an <hi>old Man,</hi> to hold forth the ſtrength and cunning of it, and its intereſt in the ſoul and body of a man. It's not a dead Carcaſs; nor is it ſeated only in the outward members of a man: Now we read of the deeds of this <hi>old man,</hi> Col. 3.9, <hi>Lye not one to another, ſeeing you have put off the old man with his deeds:</hi> theſe are the ſame with the <hi>deeds of the Body.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>By the Spirit,</hi> is here underſtood, firſt and mainly the Holy Ghoſt; by whoſe immediate Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency this work is effected: yet, 2. May be taken in alſo, the graces of the Spirit, by the act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of which this work is carried on.</p>
            <p>Now from the words, I ſhall take occaſion to ſpeak to theſe particulars in ſhort: 1. What Mortification is. 2. What's the Object and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:103420:6"/>of it. 3. The neceſſity of it. 4. What is the work of the Spirit in it. 5. I ſhall apply the whole.</p>
            <p>For the firſt: It's neceſſary in the firſt place, to ſhew you ſome baſtard-kinds of Mortification, whereby ye may know what it is not. The firſt is, A Philoſophick mortification to ſuch things as are ſeen by the light of Nature to be empty and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfactory, for Reaſon may go far here; hence ſome of the old Philoſophers ſeemed to contemn Riches, and to be above trouble for outward changes, as <hi>Diogenes,</hi> &amp;c. Yet they were either but Diſſemblers, as <hi>Seneca,</hi> who writes againſt Avarice, and tells us, That Nature was ſatisfied with water for Drink, and with a houſe of Turf; yet he was a Covetous man. So was <hi>Cicero</hi> an aſpiring man, for as much as he writes againſt Pride, not by the Spirit and the Croſs of Chriſt, but from meer moral Conſiderations, as that of the old <hi>Pagans</hi> (revived again by ſome who call themſelves <hi>Chriſtians</hi>) who taught men to moderate their inordinate deſires and paſſions, by the precepts and habits of moral Virtue. This eſpecially flouriſhed among the old Family of Philoſophers, called <hi>Stoicks,</hi> who pretended to be without all paſſions, which (ſaid they) were not incident to wiſe men. If they met with any extraordinary miſchance, they thought a wiſe man might ſtep out at any door he would, into their imaginary heaven and happineſs. Hence <hi>Cato,</hi> who was the Worlds-Wonder for his Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, ſtabbed himſelf; and his Servants finding him, bound up his wound, which when they were gone, he teared open again: yet not expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:103420:6"/>ſoon enough, he was forced to uſe ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther violence to himſelf. So <hi>Seneca</hi> and others. Now this way of Mortification, all who deny the neceſſity of ſpecial Grace (as <hi>Pelagians, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minians, Quakers</hi>) muſt needs fall into: for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever different names they give to any word, prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple or power; yet if common to every man, it's ſtill but Nature, which is capable of improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and indeed how far common Reaſon may be improved to the regulating of a mans paſſions, is plain from the manifold inſtances of old and late Moraliſts, to the ſhame of many called <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet plain it is, that they did but keep under their luſts, and not mortifie them: and that by their depreſſing one luſt, they did but exalt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; as thoſe who died for their Countrey, and forfook all for meer love of Learning; But what avails it (ſays one) to be dead to a bit of Clay, and alive to Vain-glory, which is indeed the life of Sin, and of the Old-Man. Pride eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally did grow upon the ruines of other luſts: ſo that their ſeeming Self-denial and Motification, was really but Self-magnifying. Yea, to that height of Pride did ſome of them grow up, that <hi>Lucre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> and <hi>Seneca</hi> endeavoured by Argument to exalt their virtuous men above their gods: in as much as theſe were neceſſarily good; But men were ſuch voluntarily and by choice and whoever now they be, who would leſſen <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="4 letters">

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural pravity and miſery, and who oppoſe the imputed Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, and Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by Faith, (whatever their ſeeming mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and moral endowments be) they muſt needs
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:103420:7"/>fall into the ſame Condemnation; for ignorance of theſe grand Truths, was the root that the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan</hi> Arrogance grew upon: as for that inward Tranquility that followed the moderation of their paſſions, it was but a Lye.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A ſecond Baſtard-way of Mortification, is that of the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> it ſtands in ſome outward ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verities: as lying on the Earth, whipping them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, going bare-footed, with Ropes about their waiſts begging: living in Cells, Hermitages, Vows of Poverty, and ſingle life. They ſuppoſe, ſays <hi>Luther,</hi> That when they enter their Cells, that they are crucified to the World, when indeed they are crucified to Chriſt, and Chriſt to them, Pride and Self-righteouſneſs being thereby quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. We may as well ſacrifice our lives, as ſhed a drop of blood, in ſuch a way as <hi>Baals</hi> Prieſts did, which had the ſame ground and bottom that Popiſh-whippings and Penances have. But what Pride, Epicuriſm, and monſtrous luſts have been, and are cheriſhed under theſe pretences, I need not tell you. We grant, That to keep the body in ſubjection, is a part, and a means of further mortification. But this is not to be done by rigour and cruelty: But by the ſparing-uſe of outward Comforts, and refuſing to gratifie the inordinate deſires of the fleſh. Some ſuch ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, as going naked, &amp;c. ſome <hi>Quakers</hi> have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo eſpouſed, but this is not through the <hi>Spirit</hi> to mortifie, &amp;c. Theſe means of mens deviſing, do but cheriſh Self-righteouſneſs and Pride. Satan is not ſo eaſie as to be beaten or buffeted out: were he to preach, he would preach ſuch Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine as this, and preſcribe ſuch Methods: wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:103420:7"/>ſome <hi>Pagans,</hi> who in theſe have out-gone <hi>Papiſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A 3d falſe way of Mortification, is that of the <hi>Antinomians,</hi> who place it in the want, or ſuppreſſing of all challenges of inward ſenſe and trouble for ſin; theſe they cry down as Legal, and the ground of this is another no leſs Error, <hi>viz.</hi> That what is ſin in others, is none in them: ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe even groſs outward wickedneſs. But our Lord came to redeem Sinners, not ſin: He juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies our perſons, not our ſins: this were the way to vivifie ſin, and to mortify holineſs. Sure <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> knew not then what mortification meant, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.3. But I will not rake into the aſhes of this (I hope) buried Error.</p>
            <p>The 4th falſe way of Mortification, is that which lies in refraining from ourward impieties: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the firſt motions of ſin, if not conſented to, are pleaded not to be ſin. Thus <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers:</hi> for theſe laſt have eſpouſed this among other Popiſh Errours: and if they fall not into groſs impieties, they blaſphemouſly father them upon the holy Spirit. But are not the firſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the deeds of the body? do they not flow from ſome evil principle or habit in the Soul? if they do, they are to be mortified: if you ſay, we mortifie them, when we conſent not to them: I anſwer, Mortification imports more, even the extirpation, and as much as may be, the ſupreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them; for their very being in the Soul is irkſome to the godly man: the <hi>new creature</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bear them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.24, 25; and were it not for Chriſt, we ſhould be condemned for them. Chap. 8.1. They fooliſhly tell us, that theſe
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:103420:8"/>motions are from Satan; <hi>James</hi> tells us, they are from a mans own luſt, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.14. Our Lord ſays, They are from the evil <hi>treaſure of the heart, Luke</hi> 6.45, ſo that they are plainly the deeds of the Body. But hence we ſee, what friends theſe people are to inward holineſs; and that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection they boaſt of, is but a Cheat: even ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe they were altogether free of outward acts of ſin, which yet they are too blind and credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous that believe it.</p>
            <p>A 5th falſe way of Mortification, is the laying ſin aſleep. Now a ſleeping man, looks as if he were dead: ſo does ſin, till upon ſome occaſion it be awaken'd; yea and it grows thus ſtronger than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. <hi>Saul,</hi> one would think, had now overcome his wicked malice, when he cryes out, <hi>My ſon Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, thou art more righteous than I;</hi> but it grew upon him, and ſoon broke forth with more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. It may be, that for want of opportunity, of a temptation, or provocation, thou mayſt think thy corruption mortify'd, when its only like waters bound up, or like fire under the aſhes.</p>
            <p>A 6th falſe way, is the letting of ſin die a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, or of its ſelf: as youthful luſts, vanity, prodigality, revenge, &amp;c. Either ſin kills thee, or thou muſt kill it: but when it dies alone, it's an evidence, that it has undone thee; and now like a victorious Champion, it dies in peace on its bed, and is not vanquiſhed by thee. O Sinner, ſhall thine Enemy die in peace? wilt thou not purſue it to death, and be avenged on it for thy two eyes, for thy two hands, &amp;c. for all the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries, ſorrows and woes, that it has wrought thee?</p>
            <pb n="9" facs="tcp:103420:8"/>
            <p>This is a ſort of natural and neceſſary mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ariſing from impotency to ſin, and to fulfil the luſts of the fleſh. Children have no paſſions for Treaſures, Houſes and Lands, &amp;c. yet that is not mortification, there is a living ſeed of ſin there. There is as much Fire virtually in every bit of flint as would burn a City: and there's as much ſin in ſeed, in every Infant, as would ſet on fire the World. So in the aged, all the actings of the man are blunted: that which <hi>Barzillai</hi> ſays of himſelf, may be in the letter of it truly ſaid of ſome that have not mortified the deeds of the body, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19.35. There may be ſome deadneſs of actual luſts, yet Original ſin lives: as the root of the Tree is freſh, when leaves and fruit fail in the Winter: yea, it may be, when the ſtock above ground, may be either cut or rotted; for the Soul is the chief ſeat of ſin, and it never waxes old. Hence Sins that are more ſpecial, are often ripeſt in old age: ſo that the converſion of an old perſon is harder and rarer: and for bodily ſins, if the caſe be altered, it's from no change upon the ſoul, yea, nor is ſin gone out of the body; but as Flint or Steel have Fire virtually in them, even when beaten into duſt, though you cannot now ſtrike it out of them; So there is ſin in the very duſt of Sinners, for they go to their grave with their bones full of it, and that not only in reſpect of the guilt thereof.</p>
            <p n="7">7. There's another ſort of counterfeit Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, which is more occaſional and tranſient: The ſight of a dying dear Friend, or an occaſion of ſome great loſs by Sea or Land; the ſudden fall of ſome great man; the burning of a ſtately
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:103420:9"/>Houſe or City, the pain and ſickneſs, the miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and ignominous end of ſome Sinner, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſome unclean wretch; theſe often excite ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence of ſin, ſome contempt of the World: how many unmortified ſouls can on ſuch occaſions talk of the vanity of the World, and the miſchief of ſin! And ſuch may even die, with theſe or the like words in their mouth, O what is man! he is like water ſpilt upon the ground. O this vain vexatious World: I would not live again for a Kings Crown. Sore trials, eſpecially of long continuance, breed a wearineſs of the World, and a ſort of careleſneſs of worldly concerns, which is often miſtaken for Mortification. Sometimes this tranſient mortification comes from ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Convictions, from ſome awaking work, which is ordinarily accompanied with ſome reſtraining-grace. <hi>Judas</hi> can now deſpiſe his thirty pieces of Silver: when the ſmell of Hell comes up into a mans noſtrils, it will make him throw away his Idols. When <hi>Achan</hi> is to be ſtoned, he thinks not much of his wedg of Gold: when under Convictions, Sin often couches and contracts its ſelf: and when theſe are over, it dilates its ſelf. None of theſe occaſions are fit ſeaſons for men to make a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their mortification. So much for the counterfeits of Mortification: Amongſt which I might have reckoned that which naturally ariſes from mens Complexion, by reaſon whereof, ſome are more meek, temperate, chaſte than others: which when ſet off by Wit and Learning, looks very like Mortification.</p>
            <pb n="11" facs="tcp:103420:9"/>
            <p>Come we now then to ſhew what it is, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſeen what it is not. Mortification may be either actively or paſſively conſidered: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered actively, it is a work of the Spirit; whereby the Soul ſtrives not only to beat down the motions and ſtirrings of every ſin, but endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to deſtroy the body of it, and to ſlay it in the root thereof: which in ſome meaſure every Believer does effect. Mortification paſſively con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, lies in a deadneſs of the whole Man, in order to things forbidden: and in ſome ſenſe alſo to things lawful; the Soul is taken off from ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Objects, and from inordinate appetite of law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Objects.</p>
            <p>Now to ſpeak to it in both theſe Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: Mortification actively conſidered; it lies not in unconſtant, uneven, and flaſhy fits of indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and oppoſition againſt ſome ſin; as ſome take vengeance upon ſome ſins, and ſpare their prime luſt, as <hi>Saul</hi> did the King of the <hi>Amale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kites:</hi> but it's a conſtant and daily warring of the Soul againſt great and ſmall, eſpecially againſt our Idol-luſts, wherein the man not only endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to deſtroy the love of ſin, and delight in it, but the very being of it. And this leads us to the ſecond thing propoſed, the conſideration of the object of Mortification, actively conſidered.</p>
            <p>And this is firſt and chiefly the ſin of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; <hi>Paul</hi> calls it <hi>a Body of Death,</hi> Rom. 7.24. It was this that <hi>Paul</hi> had moſt in his Eye, it was this that laid him low: it was the ſight of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal Sin eſpecially that firſt ſlew him, <hi>Ver.</hi> 9. And after all his Attainments, it's this that keeps
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:103420:10"/>him humble; and O, how blind are they that ſee not this Body! and no man that ſees it, but will ſay of any ſin, <hi>Am I a Dog to commit this?</hi> It will keep a man upon his Watch-Tower, and help to maintain a holy fear and diffidence of ſelf, and dependance on Grace. It it right con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions of this, that advances the Souls eſteem of Chriſt; of his redemption, and of free grace, yea, of the all-ſufficiency of grace: <hi>O wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me!</hi> as if he had ſaid, If ever grace or ſtrength were poſed, it would be in delivering of me, &amp;c. <hi>but I thank God through Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> ver. 25.</p>
            <p>And indeed the ſinfulneſs of Sin, the exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſinfulneſs of Sin, the myſterie of it is never underſtood, till the Original pravity of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be ſeen, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.13. Sound Convictions diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the evil of actual ſins, but they let us ſee more malignity in this, than in all the ſins of our life: yea, than in Murders, Adulteries, Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Swearing: it's a fruitful womb that has mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of ſin in it, and would be eternally bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth, though there were no Devil to tempt, nor to Midwife it into the World. And final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they let us ſee, that its being tranſmitted to us, and not contracted by us, does not leſſen the guilt nor danger of it.</p>
            <p>Here then Mortification muſt begin: it will be in vain to dam up the ſtreams, while the Fountain runs, it will either carry down the dam and run the more impetuouſly, as is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in the caſe of many, who have been a while under reſtraints; or it will run out ſome other way, and find out another Channel for it ſelf.</p>
            <pb n="13" facs="tcp:103420:10"/>
            <p>And indeed mens deviſed falſe methods of Mortification, ſerve only to dam up ſin, or to lop off its branches: it's the light of the Spirit accompanying the Word, that only diſcovers this, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.7, <hi>I had not known,</hi> &amp;c. and it's by the Spirit only that this is mortified, as the Text ſhews: hence it is only the true Believer that does any thing to purpoſe in this; and the more the Believer is exerciſed in the mortification of Original corruption, the weaker and fainter are the acts of Sin, and the ſtronger and the purer are the actings of his Grace; for it's the ſtrength of this that does ſenſibly weaken the actings of Grace, and does ſecretly and inſenſibly weaken the principle of Grace. Now this corruption of our Nature is ſometimes called, 1. <hi>A body of ſin,</hi> to hold out the greatneſs of it; and 2. <hi>A body of death,</hi> becauſe it works death, and has Death and Hell in it, and becauſe of its being loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom and burthenſom to the Believer. 3. It's cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Enmity againſt God,</hi> Rom. 8.7, to ſhew its deſperate and dangerous Nature: 4. It's called <hi>Sin that dwelleth in us,</hi> Rom. 7.17, to ſhew its nearneſs to us, and its acceſs to hurt us. 5. It's called <hi>The law of ſin in our members,</hi> Rom. 7.23, to ſhew what uſurped Authority it has over us. 6. It's called <hi>The old man,</hi> Col. 3.9, to ſhew its Skill and Cunning, and becauſe it has the firſt poſſeſſion of us, and in the Regenerate is waxing feeble. 7. It's called <hi>The fleſh,</hi> Rom. 8.1. Gal. 5.24, to ſhew (as ſome think) how it is propagated, and how it is cheriſhed <hi>viz.</hi> by Fleſh-pleaſing Objects, and how it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines to Fleſh-pleaſing courſes, and puts the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:103420:11"/>fleſh in the room of the Soul. And finally, to ſhew how dear it is, even as our fleſh. 8. It's called <hi>Luſt that intices,</hi> to ſhew its reſtleſs Activity; it will not let thee alone, though thou wouldſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear it, <hi>James</hi> 1.4. 9. It's called <hi>A root of bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs,</hi> Heb. 12.15, to ſhew its hidden Nature, and its fixedneſs in the Soul; and that as in its Soil (it is not ingraft or inoculated in us); ſo does it influence our Actions: there is no ſap in the Branches but what comes from the Root: but O the bitter fruits of it! there's no true ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the Root, nor in the Branches: Lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, ſorrow and wo grow upon it! Now, how this ſhould be mortified, may come to be ſpoken to in the Application.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Effects or Actings of this Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Corruption, are alſo the Objects of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification actively conſidered. This bitter Root has many Branches: this Body has many Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers: Theſe <hi>Paul</hi> calls <hi>our Members which are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth,</hi> Col. 3.5, that though differing among themſelves, yet make up one intire body of Sin, and does execute what the law of ſin commands. They are formed in us, as ſoon as hand or foot of our natural Body, and grow up as the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward members do; and by theſe members, Sin fights and wars againſt the Soul; and yet are they as dear to us as a right Eye, or Hand, or Foot: Finally, it holds out to us, how ſin is ſeated in every member: and ſo powerful is the law of ſin in our members, that they may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>members of ſin:</hi> they are ſo animated as it were with ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.13. Sometimes theſe be called <hi>the luſts of the fleſh,</hi> Rom. 13.14. Gal. 5.16.
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:103420:11"/>1 Pet. 2.11. The Apoſtle ſpeaks of the Kind and Species too, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.12, and <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.8. He inſinuates great variety of Luſts; 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.16, we find three eſpecial Luſts mentioned: ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times theſe are ſpoke of as acts of the mind and heart: hence it's called <hi>the imaginations of the heart; walking in the vanity of their mind.</hi> And ſometimes taking in mind and affections too: hence called <hi>the deſires of the fleſh, and of the mind,</hi> Epheſ. 2.3.</p>
            <p>Now though theſe Original Corruptions have originally the fame intereſt in the man, yet by reaſon of ſome accidental advantages, as a mans natural Complexion, Education, Employment, &amp;c. ſome get above the reſt, and prevail ſo, as to make other luſts Lacquey them, and upon every occaſion to give place: Sometimes the luſt of the Eye, that is <hi>Covetouſneſs:</hi> ſometimes that of the Fleſh, or <hi>Voluptuouſneſs:</hi> ſometimes <hi>Pride.</hi> Sin is as a great King, and theſe are its three chief Princes, that command all men under it: they are <hi>univerſal luſts;</hi> ſome call them <hi>Sins,</hi> or <hi>the Worlds Trinity;</hi> and theſe admit many ſubdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions: ſome of theſe may more properly be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>the luſts of the fleſh,</hi> that have the ſenſual and brutiſh part of men only or moſtly for them, at leaſt engage only mens corrupted affections; ſome of theſe are more ſubtil and refined, and are called <hi>the luſts of the mind:</hi> when they gain not only our affections, but our Judgment to be for them. Men by their prudence may diſguiſe their Pride, their Covetouſneſs, their Prodigali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty (eſpecially when it runs not on ſenſual Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects) and hide it not only from others, but
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:103420:12"/>from themſelves. Indeed, ordinarily the Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are firſt intangled, and theſe bribe, and byaſs and corrupt the mind, and engage it firſt to contrive the fulfilling of their luſts, and then to juſtifie them. And one would wonder to ſee men rational in other things, and ſo much blinded in the matter of their predominant luſts. Now theſe muſt be mortified: and this is held out to us, by plucking <hi>out the right Eye,</hi> &amp;c. they that are <hi>Chriſts, muſt crucifie the fleſh with the affections and luſts thereof.</hi> 1. <hi>We muſt not fulfil the luſts of the fleſh:</hi> we muſt not let Sin bring forth. Nay, 2. We muſt not let it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive: much of this Duty of Mortification lies in beating down the firſt motions of Sin, and the firſt riſings of corruption in the heart: be it of Pride, Covetouſneſs, or Unbelief; as ſoon as the evil tendency of any Thought or Imagination is diſcovered, or as ſoon as the leaſt influence of any tempting Object upon the mind, or heart or affections is perceived, it ſhould be checkt, and ſome Act of the contrary grace excited and put forth.</p>
            <p>And indeed it is (comparatively) eaſie to conquer the firſt motions of Sin: and were we making conſcience of this, we ſhould prevent much labour and ſorrow: a little ſpark is ſoon quenched, yet may it burn a City. It's ſtoried of <hi>Archimedes,</hi> That he framed ſuch Engines as could pull the ſtrongeſt Oak up by the root; and that with the wind of his Mouth, he could ſet them on work: Truly Satan hath ſuch En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines in mens hearts, and there's need humbly to recognize our Debt to Divine Grace upon
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:103420:12"/>every advantage, even againſt the fainteſt motions of ſin: and to beware of Pride, which can riſe and get up upon every Mole-hill: O, were we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der right impreſſions of the exceeding ſinfulneſs of ſin, our hearts would ſtart back at the firſt appearance of it; or, were we living near God, and in a holy heavenly frame, we would abhor every helliſh ſuggeſtion, <hi>James</hi> 4, compare 7, with 8 <hi>ver.</hi> If you be afar off, you will begin to parley with Satan, and by degrees he prevails: and by frequent viewing of ſin, tenderneſs wears off, and hardneſs comes on, and the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is defiled, which when kept pure, ſmites a man for every ſin. There's need of watchful di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, for this piece of Mortification is a labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious work; ſin is ſo active and ſtirring continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, and we naturally idolize our eaſe: and when we give up our ſelves to it, we become as Cities without walls. But O, how many deliverances from ſin, does the watchful Chriſtian Obſerve! And how many ſtones of Remembrance does he ſet up! and how much ſweet communion with God, has he in this hourly reſiſtance and morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of ſin.</p>
            <p>In the next place, let us ſpeak to Mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as paſſively conſidered; and I ſhall ſhew you to what we muſt be mortified. In general, we muſt be mortified to <hi>Self:</hi> the Apoſtle ſpeaks of his being <hi>crucified to the world,</hi> Gal. 6.14, but it's only to the World as it feeds and maintains Self; man has fallen from God to himſelf, ſo that Self is now the god of this world, and ſelfiſhneſs is the life of ſin, it runs like blood &amp; Spirit through every ſin. Now Self is either Natural, Moral, or Religious: we muſt be dead to all.</p>
            <pb n="18" facs="tcp:103420:13"/>
            <p n="1">1. For natural Self, we muſt be mortified to it: and, 1. To all natural Abilities and Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments; to Strength: Strength is the glory of <hi>Behemoth,</hi> and is ſubdued by Age; the Roſe and the Lilly has more Beauty than thou. Bloud is a borrow'd good, its the Parents glory, not thine; we muſt be mortified to Strength, Beauty, and Bloud, and honourable Birth; yea to life it ſelf; this was eminent in <hi>Paul.</hi> To be mortified to Life, is to have Life: for Chriſts mortification to life, is our victory in ſuffering-times, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.11. Love of life is the life of ſin, when it is not loved in God. 2. To the <hi>Mammon</hi> and to the Pleaſures of the World; <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith not only as <hi>Samuel, Whoſe Ox,</hi> &amp;c? 1 Sam. 12.3. but, <hi>I have co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veted no mans ſilver, or gold, or apparel,</hi> Acts 20.33, and <hi>Lev.</hi> 26.36. Deut. 38.65. What is Courage, when he can make the ſhaking of a Leaf, bring on fear, and terror, and fainting? there's a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Confidence men have in Riches, which is the life of Covetouſneſs: <hi>Job</hi> purges himſelf of this, <hi>Chap.</hi> 31.24, 25, <hi>If I have made gold my hope; or have ſaid to fine gold, thou art my Confidncee; or have rejoyced, becauſe my wealth was great.</hi> A poor man that wants bread, may be he is not tempted nor troubled with vexing deſires of ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuls of Gold, hunger and want being his door-Enemy, and lies between him and the hope of great Riches; and yet there are often delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Speculations, and tumbling-waves, and floods of wiſhes for ſuch Riches: ſo that the heart is not mortified to the love of Bread, nor of Riches either.</p>
            <p>Indeed, the deſire of Food and Raiment is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:103420:13"/>and lawful, but it's the unmeaſurable, the doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, anxious, diſeaſed deſire that muſt be mortified: the feveriſh man calls for drink, but it's not ſo much the man, as the diſeaſe that deſires it; for it helps not the man, but the diſeaſe. 2. There muſt be deadneſs to Pleaſures: Voluptuouſneſs is the moſt lively luſt in ſome, the fleſh is the maſter in moſt men: the wretched Soul muſt ſerve and lacquey it, muſt plot and contrive to ſatisfie it; muſt think, and will, and love as it pleaſes: and in moſt men it yiedls a willling ſubjection to ſinful fleſh, and is pleaſed when it can pleaſe the fleſh. What diſorder has ſin made? ſome groan under it, others cheriſh it: O the delicacy and ſoftneſs of ſome! ſome make a god of their Belly, others of their Beauty, and beſtow their coſt and labour upon a piece of painted Clay! Is this to mortifie the fleſh? will ſuch endure burning quick, or ſawing aſunder? Many ſtumble and fall here, <hi>Luke</hi> 14, <hi>I cannot come;</hi> the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified is dead to all his ſenſes, to the pleaſure of ſeeing, hearing, taſting, ſmelling, touching: he has his Eye under Authority, <hi>Job</hi> 31 (unmor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified looks ſpeak an unmortified heart): he can in the vigour of youth ſay as <hi>Barzillai,</hi> 2 Sam. 19.35, <hi>Can I taſte what I eat, or hear the voice of ſinging men, or women?</hi> he is dead to Sport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Jeſting, Laughing, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 2.2. Penitent <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> ſays, <hi>its mad:</hi> But were not <hi>Solomon</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that) and <hi>David,</hi> mortified men? Anſwer, It's true, they were: but though in the mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man; ſinful habits and principles are broken, and weakned, and reduced, confined and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted as it were into Corners, into languſhing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations: and though Original corruption be
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:103420:14"/>impaired, yet the <hi>old man is put off</hi> but by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees; and the Lord withdrawing, and ſome ſtrong temptation aſſaulting, this broken and dying prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple may put forth ſtrong acts of ſin, which gives ſome reprieval, yea, a ſort of reſurrection to Original ſin in the man. So that <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi> for a while, ſeem not to be the ſame men they were: and this tells us, that Mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not a days nor a years work.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This part of Mortification takes in deadneſs to a mans friends, to his Countrey, to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers houſe, to a Houſe, Lands or Eſtate of our own. Our Countrey, may be, cannot bear us, nor our words: Father and Mother may forſake us, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.15. <hi>Friends,</hi> yea all our friends, yea our inward boſom friends, may not only forſake, but abhor us, <hi>Job</hi> 19.19. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.16, Then <hi>eeaſe from man;</hi> there muſt be <hi>a ceaſing</hi> alſo from, and deadneſs to outward peace and tranquility, to days ſafety, and nights reſt; to Horſes and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots, to trading by Sea or Land, to fair and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furniſh'd Houſes, to rich, populous and ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Cities; for the Day of the Lord may be, and has been upon theſe; and the hand of the Lords Anger is yet ſtretched out.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There muſt be a deadneſs to Moral-ſelf. There muſt be a deadneſs to Wiſdom and Gifts, and Moral Excellencies; to natural and acquired parts: for the <hi>wiſdom of this world is but folly;</hi> Learning and Books are but vanity: <hi>I gave my heart to know wiſdom and folly, this alſo is vanity,</hi> Eccleſ. 1.17. Riches, Grandeur, and Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, are not ſo apt to blow up an ingenuous man, as Learning or Virtue; <hi>Knowledg puffeth
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:103420:14"/>up,</hi> who excel in Learning; who admires not the birth of his Mind, his Writings, Diſcourſes or Notions? who would not have every one reverence them, were they never ſo ridiculous; Where it even (as one ſays) to hold, that there is a World in the Moon? Men love to <hi>be called Rabbi;</hi> but <hi>my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, be not many Maſters:</hi> the mind muſt be mortified to the mind, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.1, 2, and ſo muſt be to all Moral habits and Actions: the old Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers that could trample upon Riches, were yet vainly elated with this: When <hi>Zeno</hi> heard, that his ſhip he uſed to Trade by, was broke; <hi>Well done Fortune</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>quae nos intra pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liolum compellis,</hi> who compels us to go within our Cloak: he meant, to live upon the glory of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and Virtue. A man may bear to have his Face ſpit upon, and to be trod upon, that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not endure to have his Gifts, or his Morals vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified: But Heart-riſings for Injuries of any ſort, bewray want of Mortification.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There muſt be a deadneſs to Religious Self: that is, 1. To our Graces and ſpiritual Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. Our Lord Jeſus has a Noble Self, yet was he above it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.3, he pleaſed not himſelf. Mortification ſets us above Renewed Self, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. Grace is a pleaſant and fragrant Flower, but it's not Chriſt; it grows out of him, and cut it off from him, it would wither: we muſt not truſt in New-ſelf, more than in Old, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.9. We often look to it with a neglect of Chriſt; and think that when we are once ſet right in the way to Heaven, that we can find out our way hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward. But the mortified man ſees not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in what he is; he admires not, loves not, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:103420:15"/>not in himſelf, nor in his graces, as they are in him, but as they are in Chriſt; he looks on them as drops of his fulneſs, as Rays and Beams of his bleſſed Perfections and Excellencies: hence <hi>Paul is dead</hi> to his knowledg of Goſpel-my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries: he was not rude in knowledg, yet would he not <hi>glory in it,</hi> 1 Cor. 13.2. Let us not boaſt of our Goſpel knowledg; and let us not hope in our hope, nor believe in our Faith as ſome do, who fetch their peace and joy, not from Chriſt, but from their own faith, or their own act of believing. But a little more as to the Mind: we muſt be dead to our Light; this <hi>Quakers</hi> make an Idol of: I do not mean, that we ought to deſpiſe it; or that a man ought to act a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it: but we muſt be dead to it ſo far, 1. as not to prefer any corrupt dictate of our Mind, to plain Scripture-Truths or Duties: we ought to judg of it by the Scripture, and not <hi>e contra.</hi> 2. So far, as not to lean to it in times of Tryal, or when in ſome doubt, though thou haſt been well guided in former times. It betokens evil, when one ſays or thinks there's no hazard, I'le do well enough, for I have gone through great Tryals ere now. 3. Thou muſt be ſo far dead to thy Light, as not to follow it to the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of others, if it be in things indifferent: <hi>Paul</hi> was clear enough, that he <hi>might eat fleſh, yet,</hi> &amp;c. 4. So far as to be willing, if the Lord ſo will to lead thee blind-fold, thou muſt depend upon him, when thou cannot ſee a foot before thee.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Thou muſt be dead to thy forwardneſs and zeal, 1. So far as not to venture on a ſeen ſnare or temptation, becauſe you find your heart
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:103420:15"/>in a good frame. <hi>Peter</hi> was a reſolute man, but he had nothing to do in the high-Prieſts Hall. 2. So as not to truſt thine own heart, nor to learn to thine own ſtrength: 3. Thou muſt be dead to all thy Graces and Duties: 1. ſo far as not to reſt in any meaſure of Grace, or livelineſs in Duty; may be when in a good frame, thou may readily ſay, I were a happy man, if I could hold up at this rate of praying, mourning, believing, &amp;c. When <hi>Paul</hi> was at his beſt, he reckoned not upon it: <hi>not as if I had already attained,</hi> &amp;c. 2. So far as not to attribute what we are, or do, <hi>to our ſelves,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.10, <hi>By grace I am what I am: and not I, but,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.24. 2. In point of Acceptance, either as to thy Duties, or as to thy Perſon: for the former, thou muſt not attribute it to thy Graces, or Duties themſelves, or to the livelineſs or ſpiritual manner of doing them. We are apt to ſay of Prayer (for inſtance) when anſwered, it muſt have been ſo, I or he was ſo fervent and enlarged in it; hence ſome pray fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vently for a mercy, and confidently look for it, and yet are diſappointed: and why? becauſe not dead to praying and believing, but lay more weight on Faith in God, and praying to God, than on God himſelf, or on Jeſus Chriſt. Some believe in their believing, and pray to their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. And then, 2. Thou muſt be dead to theſe, as to the acceptation of thy Perſon, and as to the matter of Righteouſneſs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.4. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4. <hi>I know nothing,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 3.8, 9. <hi>Paul counts all dung,</hi> &amp;c. And here lies the greateſt difficulty, but it's the right Art of well-doing, for one to work and to labour as hard, as if they could earn
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:103420:16"/>Heaven: and when all is done, to be ſo far dead to it, as to account it Dogs meat as to accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with God; and that it weighs not a feather in the reckoning of our Righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This deadneſs to ſpiritual-Self carries in it a deadneſs to ſpiritual Comforts: ſome are more alive to Comforts, than to the Comforter; But the Rays and Beams of the Sun, are not the Sun: That's the true light of Mortification, when one is alive only to their objective happineſs; when one is dead to ſenſible feelings and actual Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts: It's true, that feeling, and ſenſible Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, are in themſelves ſweet and deſirable things: But herein we are to blame, when our Comfort ariſes either from our own act of Love, Joy, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, or from the effects of Gods love to us, more than from the <hi>God of all Comfort.</hi> Now ſome may think much of this; yet it's plain, that we muſt be dead to theſe: 1. ſo as not to Queſtion the love of God, only for the want of them: 2. So as not to be angry with him, when he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds them. It's neceſſary we be ſenſible of it, but it's ſinful when we charge him fooliſhly for denying of them: for as the Night and Evening<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhadows are good for Flowers and Herbs, and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than a continual hot Sun; ſo are deſertions of ſpecial uſe, they feed humility, and quicken hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and thirſt. 3. So as to maintain an humble hardineſs in believing under angry like dealings, eſpecially when we have ground to think they are only for trying and humbling us; indeed, when ſin has ſmoaked out Chriſt and Comfort; That's like a Boil (ſays one) on each ſide, that a man cannot eaſe himſelf on either. 4. So as not to be ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:103420:16"/>when we have them. Some carry, as if heavenly Comforts could maintain themſelves, <hi>Song.</hi> 5.1, 2. 5. So as to be in caſe to mourn with them <hi>that mourn,</hi> and not ſo to be taken up with your perſonal Comforts, as to be untouched with the Concerns of Chriſt, or the afflictions and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of his followers. See <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.23. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare with <hi>Chap.</hi> 10.2, 3.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, a mortified man is dead as to the ſenſe and feeling of great outward and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward trouble: if it be agood time with a child of God in common, he forgets his own private ſad exerciſe. 2. In as far as his trouble and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row may weaken his heart or his hands in Duty. 3. In as far as they encline you to quarrel with the holy Majeſty of God; rather forget your ſorrow, and ceaſe thinking on it, when you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do it, without reflecting on God.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This takes in a deadneſs to Priviledges, to a flouriſhing Church-ſtate; if the Lord will <hi>plow Zion like a field,</hi> we muſt ſay Amen to the word of the Lord, as the Prophets of old did; we muſt be dead to godly Rulers, (indeed this is not the temptation of the day: though I doubt not but many now alive have faulted in this kind, and are ſmarting for it) to ſudden and miraculous deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verances; to the glory of Martyrdom &amp; ſufferings. True, now few exceed in coveting this, yet many have: Finally, to Miniſters and Ordinances: for <hi>Judg and Prophet,</hi> Iſa. 3, and teaching-Prieſt may be taken away, and <hi>Viſion may ceaſe;</hi> the Ark and the Tabernacle, and the Temple, are not God; the Temple may be burned,— and the Sanctuary prophaned, and ſuch as enjoy them, need not glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:103420:17"/>over others, as the unmortified remnant who abode in the Land, and in the City, gloried over their captive Brethren, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 11.15, <hi>Get you far from the Lord, unto us is this Land given in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We do not mean, that men ſhould be morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied to the preſence of God in Ordinances: you cannot be lively enough in following of God in Ordinances, but you muſt be dead to the pureſt Ordinances (though the choiſeſt outward mercy) externally conſidered ſo far, 1. As not to hang and depend too much upon them: how many of theſe Nations that were lately as the Garden of God, are now like a parched Wilderneſs? who have now inſtead of pure Ordinances, and ſweet Goſpel-Preachers, only dumb-Dogs, and dead forms. 2. So as not to pay too dear for them, nor to buy them at the expence of Truth or Holineſs: no ſufferings are too much; but any ſin, any wrong to God or Chriſt, is too much for them. 3. So as not to limit the Lord to them: we often ſinfully tie Gods preſence to preaching, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, breaking bread, &amp;c. and have a carnal zeal and livelineſs to means and naked Ordinances. Some tie their Faith, and Edification, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort ſo to an Ordinance, or to one man, as they cannot be content if they get not their deſire. A godly Miniſter may be too much alive to Preaching, and bear reſtraint with ſinful Impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience; and a private Chriſtian may be too eager, and hang too much upon one mans mouth: But ſo much of God and Chriſt, and the ſubſtance of the Goſpel, muſt be over-look'd, as Means are idoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed. 4. Then we muſt be ſo far dead to them,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:103420:17"/>as humbly to ſubmit to the want of them, and not miſdoubt God, but to believe that he will make them up to us; He will be inſtead of a San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary, and Ordinances, and Miniſtry, if we do not ſinfully put them away: or if we be duly ſenſible of his diſpleaſure, and humbled for our Church-deſolating ſins: He can reſtore them, and in the mean while afford ſubſiſtance another way: yea, if it were to feed us with a Rod; for ſome have thriven better by a ſanctified Rod, than they have done by lively Ordinances.</p>
            <p>In the third place, we come to conſider the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of Mortification: this the Text does plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hold out to us. The Queſtion then is, Upon what grounds is it neceſſary? I Anſwer, 1. More generally: It is neceſſary by virtue of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God: this the Text points out, and it's expreſs, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.5. And indeed, wherever Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is commanded, this is; for, Mortification is a great part of Goſpel-holineſs: for the <hi>Covenant of works,</hi> it takes no notice of this, for it ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes no ſin to mortifie. Now in the Goſpel-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, take notice, 1. of Gods Authority; He has right to Command, and Authority to puniſh Diſobedience: look to it, for your allowing your ſelf in any ſin, imports ſome forgetfulneſs or neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of this Authority. And it ſhould be a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians care to keep up the ſenſe of this, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuch things and occaſions wherein ye are moſt like to neglect it; as in ſecret Retirements, and Enjoyments, and Temptations: or in your con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap> with others, may be, ungodly perſons, whereby caſting off the ſenſe of this, we often caſt the honour of our profeſſion to the ground, and by
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:103420:18"/>out ſinful neglects or compliances, unframe our ſelves: or in the matter of our Trade, wherein many allow themſelves in ſome thing leſs or more, that is of ſuch ſecret uſe and gain to them, that no ſenſe of Gods Authority can move them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſh or mortifie it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Let us conſider, that Mortification is the killing of our Diſeaſe, of that which would kill us: it's the cure of the depravation of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which thus came to paſs: Man not being contented with his Eſtate, would be as God; and by this means fell from what he was, and became like <hi>unto the beaſts,</hi> 2 Pet. 2.12. Man has now more of the beſtial, than of the Divine Nature; and men out of Chriſt, have not only to anſwer for the enormities of their Actions, but for the debaſing of their Nature. But let us conſider this corruption of our Nature, not as it renders us obnoxious to wrath, but as it is our miſery; for Man is now like a condemned Malefactor, that has alſo a mortal Diſeaſe upon him; and that needs not only a Pardon, but a Phyſician. And then Mortification muſt be our cure; It was the great reſult of <hi>Solomons</hi> fearch, that he found that at firſt Man was not of the ſame make and mould that now he is of, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.29. Sin has now cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted and blinded the mind, and debauched the whole Man, and brought him under the power of his divers luſts: he is now become fleſh: if any remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of light peep out, but ſmothers, or blows it out: What diſorders have mens luſts filled the World with? ſee ſome hint of Nature, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.13, 14, 15, 16. It's not the <hi>outward man</hi> he intends only, but eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the <hi>power of mens luſts,</hi> and the inward readineſs
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:103420:18"/>of the mind to all ill. The thouſand part of what is plotted there, breaks not forth: for one man can contrive more wickedneſs, than all the World can Act. See ſome account of <hi>mans inward wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs,</hi> Gen. 6.5, <hi>Evil, only evil, continually evil;</hi> Mens luſts are inſatiable; ſuch as have the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt opportunities and advantages for ſatisfying them, do but encreaſe them; and this is mens ſin and plague both, and iſſues into mens ruine: and the leſs men know or feel this, the greater their miſery, ſo that Sinners heaven is indeed a part of Hell in them, for their luſts even now do torment them: and all their relief is in their various ſinful Objects, which feed their luſts, and encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes their miſery.</p>
            <p>Now Mortification only can cure this; true, ſome are naturally of a ſedate temper, and not ſubject to ſuch perturbations and enormities as others. But there may be more dirt and mud at the bottom (ſays one) where there be feweſt Waves: and a River may run with great ſtrength, when yet it runs ſmoothly and without noiſe. Some are ingeniouſly educated, which may a little poliſh the <hi>outward</hi> and <hi>inward man</hi> both; but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining of luſts, is not mortifying them: there's no recovery from our miſery and ſervitude, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders through our Corruptions, but by <hi>the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off the old man,</hi> and mortification of <hi>the body and its deeds.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let this then be a ſecond Conſideration, which ſhews the neceſſity of it, <hi>viz.</hi> That it's the cure of our ſin and miſery, which lies in the frame and actings of corrupt Nature. If any ſay, That thoſe who ſet themſelves to mortifie ſin, do but
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:103420:19"/>raiſe tumults and diſorders in the Soul: who has leſs inward quiet than <hi>Paul?</hi> Rom. 7. Some that are well Educated, and of good natural Tempers, ſeem to have the better of many who pretend to Mortification.</p>
            <p>I Anſwer, 1. The peace of unmortified Souls, is much like that in Hell among the Devils: they are all combined againſt God, and are not divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded amongſt themſelves. If this ſort of peace pleaſe you, you may have your fill of it in Hell. 2. Other mens peace proceeds from their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of ſervitude, rather than to endure the trouble of a Conqueſt-World; If the Believer give the Tyrant Sin it's will, he ſhould have peace with it, but he chuſes the trouble of a conſtant War with it, rather than to War with God and his Conſcience. Sin Reigns over others, and keeps all quiet: but Grace Reigns in the Saint; and Sin rebels and breeds ſome diſturbance; but never is able to ruine and diſſolve the Government of Grace. 3. It is indeed no trouble to the godly man to oppoſe ſin, for he does it with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light; he has peace with God, and joy in his heart, when he is in the midſt of his Conflict with ſin; and the more vigorouſly he oppoſes ſin, the greater is his peace: he is heartned and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated, when he remembers what he contends for, and when he thinks on his Aſſiſtants: And more, when he feels ſtrength renewed, he is put on fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent acting of Faith, and there is ſome inward pleaſure in every act of Faith: yea, and when ſin is too ſtrong for him, he is drawn forth in Acts of godly ſorrow; wherein the Believer has a real pleaſure; the trouble of others for ſin, is but the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:103420:19"/>beginning of ſorrow, and of the ſame kind with that which is in Hell: therefore they would fain flee from them, but ſorrow for ſin is the bittereſt fruit of theſe Conflicts, yet it is mingled with Joy. Outward Joys have a ſting and a wound in them, and the mortified man is uneaſie under them; But <hi>godly ſorrow</hi> has a ſweetneſs in it, therefore the Believer by all means ſeeks to cheriſh it. Finally, Every advantage he gets againſt ſin, raiſes his heart; and the hope, yea, the aſſurance he has of a final Conqueſt, does ſo far animate him, that he can antidate Praiſes, and ſing a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph in the ſight of Victory, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.25. He finds, may be, ſome ſtrong Luſt ſo rooted in his natural Temper (which one well reſembles to the mire, without which the Ruſh cannot grow) which has often prevailed; and to the acting of which his own heart prompts him, and Satan alſo ſolicites him; yet when he looks to Chriſt, to his ſtrength, and grace, and redemption from the guilt and power of ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.25, and to <hi>the ſure word of Promiſe,</hi> Rom. 6.14, he is heartned to oppoſe it.</p>
            <p>May be, ſome will further ſay, that many who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to Intereſt in Chriſt, and to <hi>have the Spirit;</hi> are yet proud, vain, paſſionate, envious, unpeaceable, revengeful; How then does Mortification cure the diſtempers of our Nature? Anſwer, If any who pretend to <hi>have the Spirit,</hi> be ſuch, the more ſhame to them; theſe are unlike to <hi>the fruits of the Spirit,</hi> Gal. 5.22.</p>
            <p>But many lay claim to that which they have no right to: and <hi>by reaſon of ſuch, is the way of God evil ſpoken of,</hi> What has given ſo much oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:103420:20"/>to men to Preach and Print, That <hi>Noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts</hi> are the worſt Parents, Maſters, Miſtreſſes, Wives, Neighbours, &amp;c. If there be ſuch, or if any pretend to <hi>the Spirit,</hi> who do not thereby mortifie, &amp;c. Let us rather queſtion or deny their Religion, than that Grace or <hi>the Spirit</hi> does not mortifie ſin. 2. Some need more Grace to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie ſin than others: Some have as much as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, yet not enough (if I may ſay ſo) for themſelves. Some have a harder task than others in mortifying <hi>the deeds of the Body:</hi> Sin has grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter advantages in ſome than in others: ſome are under worſe circumſtances than others, ſuch as raiſes and draws forth their corruptions, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.6, <hi>Her Adverſary provoked her ſore, for to make her fret.</hi> Some have fewel daily laid in for their Corruptions; and it may be want of this, that makes others corruptions look as if dead: as Fire wanting fewel, and when under aſhes, looks as if it were gone out: So it may be ordered for the tryal and humiliation of ſome. What Saint al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſeems more impatient than <hi>Job?</hi> yet who more mortified than he. Finally there is in every Believer, a ſpiritual principle that is working to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the death of all ſin. But for the expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the matter, our utmoſt diligence is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5. Sin is at firſt really wounded, but not at once killed: and when we purſue not our advantage againſt it, it recovers ſome ſtrength, and rages, and is exaſperated more, than where it was never touched.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Let us conſider, that it was our Lords Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand into the World to <hi>deſtroy ſin,</hi> which is the <hi>work of the Devil:</hi> it was ſin that crucified and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:103420:20"/>killed him: and it ought not to live in us; but by his Death he ſlew and vanquiſhed ſin, and by the vertue of Chriſts Croſs muſt we mortifie it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.14. It's a chief Bleſſing we have by Chriſt; to be able to overcome ſin. What was Chriſts mind upon the Croſs ſet upon? it was <hi>the purging away of ſin,</hi> Epheſ. 5.25, 27. See wherefore <hi>God ſent him,</hi> Acts 3.26. Now he turns not only from, but againſt ſin: by Converting-grace he turns from ſin; by exciting and Aſſiſting grace he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves in us the death of ſin; They have moſt of Chriſt, and are the beſt Chriſtians, who have their corruptions moſt mortified. Value this more than talking, more than a plauſible way of praying, &amp;c. yea, more than Raptures.</p>
            <p>It's our ſin and ſhame, that we improve not our Chriſtianity more to the deſtruction of ſin, and that we do not more promote the glory of Chriſt: by his holy ſpotleſs life he bore witneſs againſt ſin, <hi>and condemned it;</hi> and by our Imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of him, we ought to glorifie his holy life; by our ſins we beſpatter it, and others are apt to think ſuch a one was Chriſt. By his Doctrine he has alſo cryed down <hi>and condemned ſin;</hi> he preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and prayed againſt it, <hi>John</hi> 17.17. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced at the ſight of the ruine of it, <hi>John</hi> 12.30. His Word is a Glaſs to ſee it in: his Promiſes and Threatnings are ſo many Methods againſt it; and by eſchewing ſin, we adorn the Doctrine of God our Saviour, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.10. Moreover, As a <hi>Prieſt</hi> by his death, <hi>he condemned ſin in the fleſh,</hi> and we ought to condemn it over again. His <hi>blood purges from ſin:</hi> in Baptiſm we covenant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it; in breaking of Bread, &amp;c. Chriſts death
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:103420:21"/>is ſet forth to us, not only as a Propitiatory, but as a Pattern to us to die to ſin: we deſpiſe his bloud, and render his Croſs of none effect, when we yield to ſin. Mortification would make us look like Chriſtians: Ah! we ſpare our ſelves, and cry out of our Impotency, and the <hi>ſtrength of ſin;</hi> we ſpend our time more in fruitleſs complaints, than in endeavours. Though Chriſt as <hi>King, Prieſt and Prophet,</hi> takes away and deſtroys ſin, think not he will cure you as by a Charm. Muſt he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn it, and you Abſolve it? Muſt he kill it, when ye cheriſh it? muſt his Spirit aſſiſt you againſt it, when ye betray your ſelves into its hands? when under a Temptation, and his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ſtirs in you, he puts it to your choice, If Chriſt or ſin ſhall reign over you: and indeed it is, whether will you be Chriſtians, or not?</p>
            <p>A 4th Conſideration ſhewing the neceſſity of it, may be taken from <hi>verſe</hi> 12, <hi>We are not deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors to the fleſh:</hi> as for our bodies, we are debtors to them by the neceſſity of Nature, ſo far as not to famiſh them: they may challenge a right to what God allows; but for corrupt Nature, which inclines to pleaſe the fleſh more than God, and to care for it above the Soul; to this we are not debtors. And the Context ſhews that we are debtors to the Spirit. It's the Spirits work too, <hi>to convince of ſin,</hi> to witneſs againſt it, to reſtrain from it, and to mortifie it. Our new Nature in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines to it, our Priviledges obliges us to it: We are debtors for, and to the Spirit; and this debt we own in Baptiſm, wherein we renounce the falſe Trinity, and dedicate our ſelves to the true, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.11, <hi>Reckon not your ſelves,</hi> &amp;c. Baptiſm
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:103420:21"/>is a vowed Death to ſin: hence the Apoſtle ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues againſt living to ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.3, 4, and <hi>ver.</hi> 2, He argues not <hi>ab impoſſibili,</hi> but <hi>ab incongruo.</hi> Compare that <hi>verſe</hi> with <hi>Col.</hi> 3.3, <hi>Ye are dead:</hi> yet <hi>ver.</hi> 5. <hi>Mortifie,</hi> &amp;c. Sin is dead in Vow at our entry to Chriſtianity. Now the Apoſtle <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> 1 Ep. ch. 3.21, tells us, That it's not the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal part of it, <hi>viz. the putting away the filth of the fleſh,</hi> that effecteth this; but <hi>the anſwer of a good Conſcience towards God.</hi> God puts this Queſtion to the Conſcience: Do ye renounce ſin and Satan? the good Conſcience ſays and does it. Now every Oath of Dedication implies an exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration or conſent to a curſe in caſe of failing, &amp;c. <hi>Neh.</hi> 10.29. Now he is the only true Chriſtian, who makes conſcience of paying this debt: If ſin get any power over him, it's not of right, he owes nothing to it: and this may be his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the fleſh, when it tempts, I owe thee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Conſider the neceſſity of this in order to the Souls communion with God, who is a holy God; yea, <hi>glorious in holineſs.</hi> May be, the reaſon ye are kept at the door for many days, is your filthy garments: ye muſt fight every ſtep of near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to God, and muſt conquer 'em before the Triumph, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.24, 25. and 8.1. As Life is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured in the Text, to Mortification: ſo the more that one mortifie ſin, the more of the beginnings of this Life have they here; <hi>he that overcomes, eats of the hidden Manna,</hi> Rev. 2.17, and he is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to <hi>read his Name in the book of Life;</hi> he <hi>gets a white ſtone, and in the ſtone a new Name;</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.17, with <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.8, 14. A Chriſtian
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:103420:22"/>intermitting the exerciſe of Mortification, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not keep up Communion with God, nor the faith of his intereſt in God. <hi>If we ſay we have fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with him, and walk in darkneſs</hi> (that is, in ignorance and ſin) <hi>we lye,</hi> 1 John 1.6. <hi>God is light, and in him is no darkneſs:</hi> he is not a God that hath pleaſure in wickedneſs. Unmortified ſouls muſt needs have baſe thoughts of God: as the more profligate Heathens painted their gods in ugly and laſcivious forms: but generally Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture taught them ſomething of the purity of God; and ſuch as have no mind to be like him, will think or wiſh he were like them.</p>
            <p>Now, 1. This is neceſſary in order to our reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the Image of God; it was ſin obliterated this, and by the death of ſin we recover this, and become capable of divine Delight and Compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.5. Compare with 9 and 10 <hi>ver.</hi> 2. Without this, we can have no intercourſe with God, nor acceptance with him; your Duties affords no glory to God, and convey nothing from him to you. Of old there was no polluted thing to be brought before him: <hi>Ye cannot ſerve the Lord,</hi> ſays <hi>Joſhua,</hi> Joſh. 24.19, where he ſpeaks on ſuppoſition of their abiding in their ſins. Preaching and Praying are great Duties: but to the wicked he ſaith, <hi>What haſt thou to do,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And when ye ſtretch forth your hands, I will not hear,</hi> Iſa. 1. O what madneſs is it for the love of ſome luſt, to forfeit all the fruit of your Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties? See that ſome unmortified ſin be not a Moth in them: look what it is that diſtracts you moſt in Duty, and be jealous of that. 3. Without this, you ſhall not, nor cannot live for ever with God;
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:103420:22"/>ye are not meet to inherit Heaven, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.27, in no wiſe. Your hopes and pretences to Heaven, are but ſo many Reproaches caſt on God and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Heaven is not a place for mortifying ſin, nor can you expect that your ſins ſhould be all killed at once: nay, indeed a man that deſires not, and ſeeks not the death of every ſin, cannot with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a contradiction be ſaid to deſire or ſeek Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; nay, put an unmortified man in Heaven, and it would be a Priſon to him, as a ſtately Palace would be to Swine. <hi>Seneca</hi> brings in <hi>Nero</hi> knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at Heavens-gate: Anſwer is made, That there was nothing there wherein he delighted; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Hercules</hi> is ordered to beat him away with his Club. It's by our ſucceſs in Mortification, that we make our acceſs to, and acquire a fitneſs for Heaven: Can ye love and cheriſh ſin here, and think to hate it in Heaven? Ye miſtake Heaven, if ye think it ſtands ſo much in freedom from trouble, as in freedom from ſin: and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, the ſucceſsful practice of Mortification will clear more what Heaven is to you, than all your ſtudies and ſpeculative Contemplations of it.</p>
            <p>If any Object, that if ſin hinder our Union, Acceptance, or Communion with God; how can any on Earth enjoy theſe, ſince every ſin is not actually ſlain in any Soul? Anſwer 1. The Soul wherein ſin lives and reigns, can <hi>have no fellowſhip with God:</hi> that of 1 Joh. 1.6, does hold all you ſay of it, and expect of it, as a lye, and will prove ſuch. 2. While ſin, the dreg of our Diſeaſe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains with us, there's no perfect Communion with God, nor is the Soul ſo compleatly united and ſodered to him, but there's ſome disjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:103420:23"/>as it were; and what makes eclipſes in the Soul, but the interpoſition of ſome ſin? 3. Our Union and Communion with God in Chriſt, is by the new Nature, through the Spirit; it's only in ſo far as we are freed from ſin. Now whatever ſin be in the perſon, there's none in this new Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; the ſeed of God is pure and undefiled with ſin. 4. While we are purſuing ſin to death, there's no remainders of it that debars us from Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with God, according to the Covenant of Grace. None were cut off of old from the congregation for being defiled, that did not neglect the appointed Purifications. Hear the rule of our acceptance with God, and of continued Communion with him; <hi>If ye through the Spirit do mortifie,</hi> &amp;c. Finally, the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian that makes conſcience of Mortification, is help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his work by his Union and Communion with God in Chriſt; there's ſome Union neceſſary to the taking away of ſin: and there is ſome that is the reward of Mortification. Our Lord took not his Church to be one with him, to be his Spouſe, becauſe ſhe was pure, but that he might make her ſo, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.25, 26, 27. In a word, we cannot have full nor immediate Union and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God, till we be like the Angels in Heaven: nay, till we be like God; which is the higheſt deſcription of Heaven. 6. Ponder the weight of the firſt word of the Verſe, <hi>If ye live,</hi> &amp;c. Compare with <hi>Col.</hi> 3.6, which ſhews the neceſſity of it. Finally, Conſider the neceſſity of it in order to <hi>Eternal life; Ye ſhall live,</hi> Compare the Text with <hi>Col.</hi> 3.4, 5. <hi>Mortifie therefore,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>In the fourth place, we ſhould conſider what is the Spirits work in Mortification. Of this a
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:103420:23"/>word only. I Anſwer, 1. The Spirit diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ſin; ſin is the fruit of <hi>Ignorance,</hi> Acts 26.18. Satans Kingdom is a <hi>Kingdom of darkneſs:</hi> Sin reigns by Deceit, it <hi>entices,</hi> James 1.14. There the Apoſtle ſpeaks not of outward Objects <hi>allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> Now the Spirits Light makes ſin manifeſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.18, 19. It diſcovers that to be ſin, which the light of Nature never charged a man with, <hi>John</hi> 16.8. 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.20. Now diſcover ſin once, and you ruine it, it cannot abide the light; this ſets a man a-work to War with it, and deſtroy it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Spirit affects with ſhame and ſorrow for ſin; it lets the Soul ſee ſin, not only in the glaſs of the Law, but of the Goſpel, as it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Chriſt and the love of God; and this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitters it, and raiſes the heart againſt it. The Soul cannot endure that that which was the death of Chriſt, ſhould live in it, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.10. The Spirit alſo lets a man ſee ſin practiſing and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring againſt his Soul, plotting and acting againſt his life: and ſo true ſelf-love ſets a man to ſeek its death, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.11; yea, and lets him taſte ſo much bitterneſs in it, and gives ſuch experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal knowledg of the malignant nature of it, that makes a man weary of it, and ſeek to extirpate it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The New Nature which <hi>is born of the Spirit,</hi> cannot bear it: the Spirit hence is ſaid to <hi>luſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the fleſh,</hi> there's a contrariety between them, that like Fire and Water in the Cloud, make a thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in the Soul: the man that wants the Spirit has no principle in him that oppoſes ſin, as ſin; or that ſeeks the death of ſin.</p>
            <p n="4">4. By the Spirit we are united to Chriſt: and by vertue of this Union with Chriſt, we are enabled to
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:103420:24"/>overcome ſin, we thereby receive ſtrength and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies of Grace, and are made conformable to him: <hi>we are crucified with him, and die with him, and riſe with him,</hi> Gal. 6.14. The Soul ſees not only a Pattern of Holineſs and mortification to ſin, in Chriſt, but is made partaker of the ſame holineſs that is in Chriſt, and ſo has the ſame abhorrence of ſin; and the nearer it be to the Soul (the Lord Jeſus had no ſin in his perſon) the more it loaths it. That which put him on <hi>deſtroying the works of the Devil,</hi> prompts them to ſeek the deſtruction of ſin.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The Spirit promotes Mortification, by actuating, aſſiſting, and ſtrengthning Grace in us; the Spirit excites the exerciſe of Grace. Now ſays <hi>Paul, If ye walk after the Spirit, ye ſhall not,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.16. Compare it with <hi>John</hi> 7.38. The exerciſe of Grace engages the Spirit to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt his own work; and this he will do, if not grieved. And thus the Spirit does not only hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the fulfilling or bringing forth the luſts of the fleſh, but alſo marrs the conception of them: the Spirit by filling with the fruits of holineſs and righteouſneſs, leaves no room for the works of the fleſh, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.19, 21. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.11. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.9. Now theſe Acts of holineſs, &amp;c. the Apoſtle calls <hi>the fruits of the Spirit:</hi> for theſe the Spirit excites and produces, not by moral means only, but by an internal immediate effectual work, for which end eſpecially he dwells in them, <hi>viz.</hi> to cheriſh his own work, and to excite the act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Grace; as in the old Creation, <hi>the Spirit moved upon the waters,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and they brought forth living creatures:</hi> ſo does he move upon the New Creature in the Soul, and it brings forth fruits:
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:103420:24"/>which for this reaſon (I ſay) are called <hi>the fruits of the Spirit,</hi> Gal. 5.19. The Spirit draws forth godly ſorrow, and that is like poiſon to ſin; the Spirit draws forth Acts of Love, and this kills the love of ſin, which is the life of it.</p>
            <p>But this the Spirit does more eſpecially, by exciting Acts of Faith, which do in a peculiar way deſtroy ſin, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.9. We can never advance ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, nor ruine ſin, by meer multiplying of Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Indeed, we are ſaid to be <hi>purified by obeying the truth through the Spirit,</hi> 1 Pet. 18.2. But the Apoſtle means thereby, <hi>believing,</hi> as appears from <hi>ver.</hi> 21, (which is called <hi>the obedience of faith, Rom.</hi> 1.2.) Hence the <hi>unbelieving</hi> and the <hi>defiled</hi> are the ſame, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.15, <hi>But unto them that are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed and unbelieving, is nothing pure, but even their mind and conſcience is defiled.</hi> Now Faith does expel ſin, not only as it is a part of the Image of God renewed in us (for ſuch the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of Faith is, though indeed in its actings it anſwers not to any divine Perfection, at leaſt as it imports truſt, confidence and dependance on another) and a part of our inherent ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs. Nor only as it excites and brings into ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe other graces that tend to the mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſin in us. But</p>
            <p n="1">1. And eſpecially, as it is the Mean whereby the Spirit unites us to Chriſt, and which receives and applies the bloud of Chriſt, whereby we are cleanſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from ſin; it's called <hi>a cleaving to the Lord,</hi> Deut. 4.4. Acts 11.23, which infers a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration from ſin: and if the woman by a touch of Chriſt did fetch Vertue from him, for dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up her iſſue of Bloud, how much more ſhall the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:103420:25"/>Soul derive Virtue from him to heal its plague by a conſtant cleaving and ſticking to him by Faith? it keeps the Soul near the Fountain that waſhes away ſin; it lays ſin cloſe under the ſtroke of him who came to deſtroy ſin, and to ſave from it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Spirit does, by drawing forth the exerciſe of Faith, let into the Soul the efficacy of thoſe means that are ſubordinated to the blood of Chriſt, and have their efficacy from it, for the taking away of ſin. As 1. There is the Word, hereby we are made <hi>clean, John</hi> 15.3. and <hi>ſanctified, John</hi> 17.17. and <hi>healed,</hi> Pſal. 107.20. It is the <hi>ſword of the Spirit,</hi> Epheſ. 6.17, whereby the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit wounds and kills ſin: It's <hi>quick</hi> and <hi>diſcerning</hi> in finding out of ſin, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.12; and powerful for preventing ſin, and reſcuing from it. The Spirit brings the Word ſeaſonably to our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, and alſo puts life in it: The Spirit brings the Command with Authority upon the Soul, when the Commands and Prohibitions of the Word come in the <hi>evidence and demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Spirit;</hi> they come with power, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.4; <hi>When the Commandment comes</hi> as to <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 7. ſenſe of ſin may live, but ſin is really wounded: he that is the father of ſin could not withſtand Chriſts Word, <hi>for it was with power,</hi> Luke 4.32. None deſpiſe the Word, but ſuch as never felt this Power. 2. The Spirit puts an edg on the Threatnings: they are Corroſives to ſin, when the Spirit faſtens ſuch a Word as this: <hi>If ye live after the fleſh, ye ſhall die;</hi> it's as a Nail dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven into the Temples of ſin: Better that ſin die, than I die, ſays the Soul. 3. The Spirit makes the promiſes of the Word effectual to work out
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:103420:25"/>ſin, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1. Who would not zealouſly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pofe ſin, and throw it away, that he may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted in ſuch precious promiſes? or, who that knows his intereſt in theſe promiſes, would not ſtudy the greateſt poſſible freedom from ſin? who that knows that God is his God and Father, and will dwell and walk with him (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.16, 17.) will beg or borrow from Satan or the World: or think to better his Condition by the honours, profits, or pleaſures of ſin? Who that knows, that he is <hi>the temple of God,</hi> will prophane himſelf with Idols? and who that knows he is <hi>the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Chriſt,</hi> will make himſelf the <hi>member of a harlot;</hi> and who that has the hope of <hi>eternal life,</hi> would not <hi>purifie himſelf,</hi> 1 John 3.3? Now it's by exciting Faith, that the Spirit makes either the Commands, or Threatnings, or Promiſes of the word available to the furtherance of Mortification.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Spirit renders theſe Ordinances, we call Sacraments, effectual for the mortification of ſin. 1. For Baptiſm: It's not only the ſign of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication to Father, Son and Spirit; but it's a ſign of our fellowſhip with Chriſt in his death, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.3, <hi>Know ye not that ſo many of us, as were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized into Jeſus Christ, were baptized into his death,</hi> ver. 4: <hi>therefore we are buried with him by baptiſm into death,</hi> ver. 6, <hi>Knowing that our old man is crucified with him,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ver.</hi> 7, <hi>For he that is dead, is freed from ſin,</hi> ver. 11, <hi>Reckon,</hi> &amp;c. Now it's the baptiſm of the Spirit that effecteth this, <hi>John</hi> 1.33. <hi>Acts</hi> 1.4; and this <hi>John</hi> calls <hi>Baptiſm with the Holy Ghoſt, and with fire,</hi> Matth. 3.11. pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably alluding to the <hi>live coal</hi> which the Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phim took from the Altar, and wherewith he
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:103420:26"/>touched the Prophets lips, ſaying, <hi>Lo, thine ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity is taken away, and thy ſin is purged,</hi> Iſa. 6.6, 7. Now it's by Faith that the efficacy of this Ordinance is taken in: ſometimes at the time of the Adminiſtration of it, ſometimes afterward: what Faith Infants have, I ſhall not debate: I ſee not why ſome ſort of actual Faith may not be admitted in them; and why a ſupernatural in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct may not carry them forth to Chriſt, as well as a natural inſtinct prompts them to ſeek the Mothers breaſt. <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> leaping in his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers womb, at the <hi>ſalutation of Mary,</hi> &amp;c. does ſeem to confirm this, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.41, which did not proceed meerly from the Mothers joy, as appears from her words <hi>(being filled with the holy Ghoſt)</hi> in <hi>ver.</hi> 44. <hi>For lo as ſoon— the Babe leaped in my womb for joy;</hi> and though there may be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing extraordinary in it: yet it plainly ſays, that Infants are capable of ſome ſpiritual Acts, as well as of natural: ſo</p>
            <p n="2">2. For the Lords Supper; <hi>The bread we break, and the cup of bleſſing — is it not the communion of the body and blood of Chriſt,</hi> 1 Cor. 10.16? <hi>therein we have fellowſhip with him in his ſufferings:</hi> and all our Communion with Chriſt is through the Spirit, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.14. Hence now there is required in ſuch as partake of this, a more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial ſeparation from ſin: <hi>for we cannot drink of the cup of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. (that may be ſaid of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sins, as well as Idolatry) 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.21. And the abuſe of this Ordinance, we ſee in a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial manner puniſhed, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.30. Sometimes Satan goes down with a <hi>Sop,</hi> and it feeds ſin: but when Chriſt is indeed received by Faith, the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:103420:26"/>evil Spirit goes out: and there comes in a new re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruit of power to expel ſin.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Spirit ſanctifies Providences, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders them of uſe to the mortification of ſin: as for inſtance, The obſervation of Gods ſeverity upon others, more eſpecially our own afflictions: they are Gods Furnace, he threſhes us, that our husk may go off, <hi>Zech.</hi> 13.9. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 31.15, &amp; 48.15. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.13. Materially, all afflictions belong to the Covenant of Works; but by the Croſs of Chriſt they are transferred to the New Covenant; they are thereby made healthful, as the Tree that <hi>Moſes</hi> caſt into the waters, took away their bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs (which ſome think was a type of this); Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions are bitter, and men murmure at them, as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> at the <hi>bitter waters;</hi> but the Croſs of Chriſt makes them wholſom waters: they are like Salt to the Sacrifices, <hi>Levit.</hi> 2.13. They conſume mens excrementitious and corrupting hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours: we are apt to taint and corrupt, to ſettle on our Lees, therefore we are emptied from veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel to veſſel: Roots of bitterneſs ſpring up, <hi>that defile,</hi> Heb. 12.15; ſo Afflictions like Salt, pierce and macerate a Man; and we muſt be macera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ere we come to Heaven; and what is Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, but the quaſhing and macerating of the Iraſcible and concupiſcible faculties of the Soul? More particularly,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Afflictions are witneſſes of Gods diſpleaſure againſt ſin, yea, they are ſenſible demonſtrations of the bitterneſs of ſin: for God would have us lay all at ſins door, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.19, <hi>Thine own wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs ſhall correct thee— know therefore and ſee,</hi> &amp;c. how Gods anger at ſin, and the felt evil of it,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:103420:27"/>ſets the Soul againſt it. 2. They diſſolve that wretched union between our corruptions within, and tempting Objects without us: ſuch an Union is this, that they never preſent themſelves to our corrupted faculties, but they excite and draw out ſome ſinful Act: we never let out our hearts upon the Creatures, but we are corrupted by them: we cannot think of filthy Lucre, or ſenſual Pleaſures, but they defile us. Now the Croſs crucifies us to the World, and it to us, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.14. (Many take the Croſs there metanymically, for what we bear); the heart now is not ſo inclin'd to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Lewdneſs with them: as Rebukes from the Lord makes a mans beauty to conſume away like a Moth, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 39.11; ſo it takes off in the mans eyes, that beauty and deſirableneſs in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that drew forth inordinate deſires: and it does enervate the ſtrength and vigour of the affections, that uſed to ſtir at the firſt ſeeing or hearing of any thing that was deſirable. 3. Afflictions open a door to the Word, and lays the Soul open to its ſmitings and woundings: for when God ſpeaks in mens proſperity, they hear not: Now he does not ſpurn at reproofs of ſin, but is content to have it expoſed. 4. Afflictions, quicken the actings of Grace, of Faith, of love, ſubmiſſion, hope, &amp;c. and theſe do ſecretly wound and work out ſin. It is an ill ſign, when there is no notable acting of ſome Grace, at leaſt, or when Affliction is gone off, and no ſin wounded or ſlain; when we are conſumed with Affliction, and no ſin conſumed, <hi>Jer.</hi> 6.10; when the work is over, and done, and we purged from no ſin, and made partaker of none of the holineſs of God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.10. Tremble at the thoughts
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:103420:27"/>of this. O dreadful! to be burned up with the fire of affliction, and ſin not touched; to be wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſin whole; to be broken with affliction, and not a bone of the body of death broken: it's ſin, it's your corruptions, that the holy Lord aims, and levels his ſtrokes at: But fooliſh we, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and venture our Souls to reſcue and ſave ſin; for which of it's evil Offices is it that you will make war with God, and die for ſin? It's for ſome <hi>Sheba</hi> that God beſiegeth thee, and batters thy wall, as <hi>Joab</hi> did the City <hi>Abel,</hi> 2 Sam. 20.15, deliver him up, cut off his head, and he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, <hi>ver.</hi> 21.22.</p>
            <p>Now all this is the Spirits work, hence called <hi>a ſpirit of judgment and of burning,</hi> Iſa. 4.4. By Afflictions, the Spirit judges, condemns and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutes ſin, and helps us to judg, and condemn, and deſtroy it. When God has taken his Spirit from <hi>Saul,</hi> he runs to <hi>Endor</hi> in his ſtraits. Some are conſumed, ſome pine away: ſome are hardned when the Spirit is not at work. And finally, it's by Faith, that the efficacy of afflictions is let in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Soul: for it ſees them coming from God, and that according to his Word; and it ſees what they aim at: and ſometimes can look upon Gods chaſtning, as his proper dealing <hi>with ſons,</hi> Heb. 12.7.</p>
            <p>We come now to the Application.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. For Tryal: the Scripture tells us, there are but two ſorts of Men, two Principles, two Ends, two Ways, and two eternal ſtates of Men: And it does alſo plainly tell us to which of theſe we belong: we need go no further than the Text; to the ſame purpoſe is that, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.8, <hi>He
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:103420:28"/>that ſoweth to the fleſh,</hi> &amp;c. If you think Marks be tedious, and that ſome have too much multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed them; here's a ſhort Tryal. And were men but ſerious in applying this, they might eaſily divine what ſhall be their eternal ſtate. But here lies the difficulties: There are ſo many Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feits of Mortification, and by the power of Self-love, ſome are ſo paſſionately carried forth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſome Sins, as contrary to, and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with their happineſs; And on the other hand, where ſin is routed, yet it keeps ſome bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken feattered Forces on foot: and where it's mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, it's not nullified; That it's not eaſie to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie the ſincere Soul, nor to undeceive the pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er only: Sin ſometimes goes out, when it is not caſt out; it's often aſleep, when it's not dead; it often retires, when it's not defeated. Or, if in ſome particular it be reſiſted, it is either gratified ſome other way, or it reinforces its ſelf, and then prevails. Yea, how many Profeſſors keep up a green and flouriſhing profeſſion, that know not what Mortification means; and it may be are clean in their own eyes, yet are not purged from their ſins? And I doubt not alſo, but that for ſome time there may be ſome encreaſe of true fruits, where there is no growth downward, no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance in Mortification. Indeed, it will be hard for any long time to keep up a green Profeſſion when the root is withering, or when a man is going back in the ſecret part of Religion; If the roots of ſin be lively and ſtrong, it will be hard to keep it under-ground.</p>
            <p>Now in ſhort, There be theſe things which ſpeak out the ſtrength and livelineſs of ſin in a
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:103420:28"/>Man: 1. When a man makes a mock of ſin, and thus bids a defiance to the Almighty; and ſays Aha to his Trumpets! 2. When a man has much pleaſure in ſin, and ſins <hi>with greedineſs,</hi> Epheſ. 4.19, and does evil <hi>with both hands</hi> earneſtly, <hi>Mica</hi> 7.3: when a man ſeeks to extract all the pleaſure that is in ſin, and would ſuck out the heart of it. 3. When a man ſolicites his own heart to ſin, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.12, 13, and 7.18, and complains as it were of his ſlackneſs in it: he is not ſurprized, nor overtaken, but <hi>deviſes iniquity,</hi> Mic. 2.1. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare with <hi>ver.</hi> 3.4. 4. When a man makes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion <hi>for his luſts:</hi> when he <hi>plows wickedneſs, and ſows iniquity,</hi> and is at a great deal of pains to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie and gratifie his luſts. The Chriſtian is not at half the toil in mortifying luſts, that others are in ſatisfying them: if the one be hard work, the other is impoſſible: ſo that the poor Creature is tormented between the reſtleſs and impatient cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings of his luſts, and the weakneſs and ſcantneſs of the means he has to ſatisfie them. 5. When a man ſins under a ſmall temptation, or none at all: ſome are like Powder and Flax, ſet on fire by a ſpark: yea, ſome draw on temptations, and then out-go them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.18: they are not drag'd by a temptation, but draw, and pull, and pain themſelves to ſin: they meet the temptation mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and are glad of it, as the Jews were when <hi>Judas</hi> offered to betray his <hi>Maſter unto them,</hi> Mark 4.10, 11.6. When one is got above Convictions of ſin, and above ſhame: <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.20, the adulterous Woman ſaith, ſhe <hi>hath done no wickedneſs.</hi> Jer. 8.6, and 6.15, <hi>Were they aſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> &amp;c? <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.3, <hi>Thou hadſt a whores forehead:</hi>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:103420:29"/>or, 2. When one ſins after frequent convictions of the folly and hazard of ſin, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.10, <hi>Thou waſt wearied in the greatneſs of thy way, yet ſaideſt thou not, there is no hope:</hi> when a man will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture to wade through wrath to ſatisfie luſts, and overtake his Idols: when Divine Commands and threatnings (which to the godly man are more than Angels with drawn-Swords) are no lets nor banks to ſin: when the Omniſciency, and Holineſs, and Juſtice, and Power of God, even when actually repreſented to the man, yet does not reſtrain him from ſin. It's ſaid of ſome, <hi>that they did evil in the ſight of the Lord,</hi> 1 Kings 21.20. 3. When one hates Convictions, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to hold them out, or to kill them. 4. When one is under Rebukes for ſin; yea, may be, under terrors for ſin, yet goes on, as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.17. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 22.13, 14. <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.25, <hi>Thou ſaidſt, there is no hope,</hi> &amp;c. Ezek. 33.10.</p>
            <p>Theſe things ſhew forth the abſolute power of ſin in the Soul. But now in the ſecond place, there are ſome things that are evidences of great ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming in Mortification: yea, even in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate.</p>
            <p n="1">1. When a man is under continual indiſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Duties, and wants a readineſs of Soul to them, and is much diſtracted or diverted in them: When ſin is mortified, and Idols thruſt to the door, a man will be at more leiſure to pray, and meditate without diſturbance, and the ſpirit will be more compoſed: a mortified man has more power over his ſpirit, he is not like a City without walls: but for the unmortified, he has many to pleaſe: this Idol muſt have a look,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:103420:29"/>and this muſt have a word, and he cannot ſerve God without diſtraction, nor with all his Soul, nor with delight: nor does he thrive by his Duties, for his Idols conſume and eat up the profit of them: think on this, you who complain of diſtractons in Duties. Indeed, ſometimes the heart is carried away by more trivial Imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencies: but ordinarily it's our Idols that come in ſo freely and unſeaſonably: and may be theſe more trivial diverſions have ſome reſpect to them, at leaſt they proceed from want of a deep ſenſe of the Majeſty of God upon the heart, which alſo evidences ſome notable defect in Mortification: for as much as we die to ſin, <hi>we are alive to God.</hi> Finally, When a man wants freedom and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in his Approaches to God: a Child that's often faulting, cares not for the Fathers preſence; ſin makes a ſhyneſs to God, leſs or more it does ſecretly eſtrange the heart from him. When the North-wind of the Spirit has killed ſin, then the Spouſe is inviting Chriſt, <hi>Song</hi> 4.16: then the Soul is ſaying, <hi>O when ſhall I appear before thee?</hi> But when a temptation to gratifie carnal eaſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails, then the Soul cares not for his Company: it has no eyes, nor hands, nor legs, <hi>Song</hi> 5.2, 3, 4.</p>
            <p n="2">2. An habitual unwillingneſs to die, ſhews the power of ſome ſin: there may be ſome unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs at certain ſeaſons, proceeding from ſome other cauſe, but ordinarily this is it; a morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied man is like a ripe Apple that comes away with the touch of a hand; or as a looſe tooth, that comes out with a gentle pluck. Moreover, the more a man exerciſes himſelf in Mortification, he is
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:103420:30"/>the more afflicted with the remainders of ſin: and the more ſucceſsful he is in mortifying ſin, the more feeling he is of every motion of ſin: hence he is often crying out, <hi>I am oppreſſed, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake for me:</hi> or with <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 7.24. This Captive-exile doth lawfully haſten to be deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: this Priſoner is looking out at his Windows till Chriſt come and knock off his Irons: and this makes him <hi>groan earneſtly</hi> for his full freedom from ſin, and he cares not how faſt the <hi>outward man decay,</hi> if the <hi>inner-man be renewed,</hi> and if ſin decay as faſt: it's eaſie to die, when ſin is firſt dead; but if there be any luſt lively, the guilt of it makes a man dread Eternity, and the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to come; and the ſtrength and livelineſs of it, makes him dread death; when the Soul is ſtrongly united to any Idol, Death is like the rending of one member from another: But a mortified Soul does leave the body as chearfully, as a man throws off an old torn ragged ſuit of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.1, He is much in longing for, and in rejoycing in the hopes of Heaven; and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is Heaven to him, rather for it's freedom from ſin, than for it's freedom from troubles that now annoy; whereas an unmortified man has cold thoughts, and faint deſires of Heaven: why do ye not lift up your heads? it's either from unbelief, or ſome prevailing luſt: were you fighting for your life, the news and aſſurance of Victory would anticipate the Triumph; for the man is no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther carried out after the true happineſs, than he is taken off the falſe. Hence one that is wholly under the power of ſin, cares no more for the true perfection of the Soul, than a beaſt cares to
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:103420:30"/>be a man; yea, and the regenerate man that's un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any prevailing-luſt can hardly keep up his aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, at leaſt he has no actual aptitude and meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for Heaven; and no wonder he long not much for it; but ſee what a Song that is in, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.7, 8, <hi>I have fought the good fight of Faith,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="3">3. When the Soul is in a continual reſtleſneſs and vexatious anxiety, when there are many inward perturbations and diſorders in the Soul; may be, ſin has not the throne, yet is it breeding great tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults, and making many and great inſurrections againſt grace in the Soul: the guilt of them fills the Soul with fear; their oppoſition and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety to grace, makes them painful to the Soul, in ſo far as it is ſanctified: and then there is that Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is unſeparable from all corrupt inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and luſts, which proceeds from the impoſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to ſatisfie them; It's upon the account of this luſt, eſpecially, that the man that is defective in Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, is troubled; partly alſo in reſpect of the guilt of ſin.</p>
            <p>For the ſecond, The more ſucceſs in Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and the livelier Grace be, the more feeling has the Soul of every ſtirring of ſin, and the more pain it is to the new Creature; and indeed, the more that ſin be ſtruck at, the more it ſtruggles: the Old man has a ſtrong heart, and is loath to die; and our luſts being as a right-hand, cannot be cut off without pain; but that which is pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the Old man, is a pleaſure to the New: It's the ſtrength of remaining ſin that afflicts the New man. The more the Soul be delivered from ſin, the more it thinks it thinks it ſelf a captive, and the fuller freedom it breathes after, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.24, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:103420:31"/>of ſin in the midſt of his higheſt comforts, are worſe than Water amongſt Wine: ſo that the poor Believer needs a <hi>Banner,</hi> even when he is taken into the <hi>Banquetting-houſe,</hi> Song. 2.4. How pitiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly does the poor Spouſe ſpeak, <hi>Song.</hi> 6.13, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the <hi>ver. Return, return, O Shulamite: re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, return, that we may look upon thee;</hi> ſee her An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, <hi>What will you ſee in the Shulamite? as it were the company of two Armies:</hi> Alas! What will you ſee in me, but War, and Bloud, and Rebellion? when the poor Chriſtian thinks he has cut off one head of ſin, there ſtarts up another, or more: the more you make it your work to mortifie ſin, the more diſcoveries you ſhall have of ſin; and the more ye will lie in wait to diſcover it, the more of the Spirits light ſhall you have to ſee ſin: That which is but a ſhadow to others, is a Body to <hi>Paul,</hi> it was once otherwiſe with <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 7.9. He was as whole and ſound as any man: he was as little troubled with ſin as the <hi>Phariſees</hi> of our time, who with diſdainful pride ſcoff at the humble bemoanings, and ſelf-abaſing confeſſions of ſerious Chriſtians, and will not admit that <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 7, ſpeaks of himſelf, as Regenerated. I wonder what ſuch think of their own Liturgie, which frequently teaches them to call themſelves <hi>miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſinners:</hi> at which the <hi>Quakers</hi> were wont as fooliſhly to Triumph, as now they do at us for the like humble acknowledgments of ſin.</p>
            <p n="4">4. When the reflecting upon, and remembring of former luſts and Idols, do excite our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or is accompanied with delight, or does pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke new deſires, <hi>Ezek</hi> 23.19, <hi>ſhe multiplyed her whoredomes, in calling to Remembrance the days of
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:103420:31"/>her youth;</hi> or as it is <hi>ver.</hi> 21, <hi>The lewdneſs of her youth:</hi> this is an acting over of ſin. It's ſad when we cannot look upon the Picture: nay, nor read, or hear the name of our Idol-luſts, but we bow down our head, and our affection is kindled, or ſome cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt paſſion ſtirs: where ſin is mortified, every remembrance of it revives our ſorrow for it; it's like a new ſtroke upon an old wound, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially after the Soul has been held over Hell for it, and may be under much outward trouble al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo: for its indeed ſome unmortified ſin that ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily brings on deſertion and trouble, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.17, <hi>when the Moon</hi> (an Emblem of this World) <hi>is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our feet,</hi> Rev. 12.1, there can be no eclipſe of the Sun, and no ſtorms. The Lord may for his own holy ends, exerciſe the moſt mortified Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, but its ordinarily ſome <hi>root of bitterneſs ſpringing up</hi> that he ſtrikes at: And O what a Sea of temporary wrath does our indulgence to ſome ſin expoſe us too! yet how hard is it to bring us to lay all at the door of a beloved luſt! it were eaſie to cure moſt mens inward troubles, were they but faithful to themſelves.</p>
            <p n="5">5. When one is not conſtantly underfelt-need of Chriſt, not only to ſave from the guilt, but the power of ſin. The man that labours in Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, he is hourly calling on his Aid, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not live without Chriſt, ſin is ſin indeed to him; and Chriſt is Chriſt indeed to him: he cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt Chriſt enough, nor magnifie the grace of God enough: he ſees it's no little help he needs, and that no common aid will ſerve his turn; (I do much queſtion if ſuch as oppoſe the doctrine of ſpecial Grace, ever knew what Mortification was)
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:103420:32"/>he ſpeaks with another ſpirit than the <hi>Phariſee,</hi> when <hi>he thanks God that he is not like other men,</hi> Luk. 18.9, 10. (You ſee the <hi>Free-willers</hi> (as you vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly call them, for ſuch were the <hi>Phariſees</hi>) in Chriſts time owned the neceſſity of ſome Divine Aſſiſtance); how warmly doth <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeak, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.25, as he had with much feeling bemoaned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf? <hi>Ver.</hi> 24. He ſeems to want words to exalt God, and ſtops as it were in the middle: his thoughts are over-matched; thus praiſe waits, or is ſilent for God; it is ſilent to other things, and it waits to be employed about him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 65.1. The Believer is often put to a Non-plus, in crying up the grace of God, and wants words to expreſs its greatneſs; yea, to anſwer the elevation of the thoughts: the heart indites a ſong of praiſe, but he cannot tune it. The Apoſtle is ſtopt as it were through admiration (which is <hi>Silentium intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus);</hi> for when the mind can riſe no higher, it falls admiring: hence ſome ſay, <hi>God is moſt exalted with feweſt words.</hi> The experience of the ſupplies of Grace for overcoming ſin, is one of thoſe mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies that uſes to provoke the Soul to cry out, <hi>Exalt thy ſelf, O Lord! worthy art thou to receive Bleſſing and Honour,</hi> &amp;c. But thou art above all Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing &amp; Praiſe! Others make no great matter of this.</p>
            <p n="6">6. When a mans heart is pierced through with ſorrows, when his Idols are blaſted and ſmitten: when in the time of trouble, fear and ſorrow ſill the heart: when our Idols are fallen, or when our luſts out-live their Objects. As, ſuppoſe a mans Eſtate be decayed, or his dear Friends be dead, before inordinate love to them be decayed, or dead; we are apt to ſit down upon the graves
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:103420:32"/>(as it were) of our buried Idols: and cry out, Ah my Lord! Ah my Comfort! Ah my Hope!</p>
            <p>But how does a mortified man carry in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the lawful things of this World? An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, 1. With a great indifferency: If he live, if he be rich, if full, if he abound, it's well: and if he die, if he be poor or empty, it's alſo well. If <hi>David</hi> be on the Throne, it's well, he can then alſo pen Songs of praiſe; If he be at home in his houſe, in the Sanctuary, it's well; if baniſhed and chaſed from the houſe of God, it's well. <hi>Hezekiah</hi> is Victorious, the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> are ſlain, it's well. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> prophecieth that his Treaſures ſhall be ſpoiled, and his Children carried captive, this is good too. Our bleſſed Lord is the ſame, when the people ſing <hi>Hoſanna,</hi> and when they cry, <hi>Crucifie him, and ſpit in his face.</hi> The mortified man is peremptorily about nothing here: he trembles at ſuch a word, as, <hi>give me children ere then I die:</hi> nay, Children or no Children, Riches, or no Riches, that's well; or when one loves, rejoyces, weeps, <hi>as if not,</hi> &amp;c. 2. The heart goes ſlowly and faintly out after Creatures: if any thing work upon the mortified man, it affects him not much, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.24. <hi>Peter</hi> will not have the Saints burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing quick, ſtrange to them, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.12. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 131.2, <hi>as a weaned Child:</hi> Grace makes the heart move leiſurely to all things beneath God. A mortified man is as a Sea that hath no winds, that ebbs not, and flows not, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 62.2, <hi>He only is my Rock, I ſhall not be greatly moved.</hi> The mortified man ſings, and is not light; and weeps, and is not ſad; is zealous in Gods cauſe, and yet compoſed in ſpirit: he is not ſo eager on any thing, but he can quit it for God: Ah! few can
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:103420:33"/>act, but they over-act. There's often in young Converts too great and fervent out-goings of the Soul even after ſpiritual created Comſorts; this is ſome way childiſh: Mortification is a gracious well-compoſed grave temper of Soul, as for God: the man weeps, as if he weeped, &amp;c. the Soul goes forth in its full ſtrength. 3. The actings of the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified man in reference to the Creatures, are in ſome ſenſe no actings: <hi>rejoycing,</hi> &amp;c. is as no <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing;</hi> things here are but ſhadows and pictures of being (God only is); therefore our affections ſhould be but affections, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 35.12, <hi>They ſpeak miſchievous things:</hi> ver. 13, <hi>But I as a deaf man heard not.</hi> Pſalm 39.9, <hi>I was dumb,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Eccl.</hi> 2.8: he cannot find in his heart to ſing and dance at ſhadows. Grace longs at nothing: it ſhouts, admires, wonders at nothing: it weeps alſo at nothing. The mortified man he is dead, <hi>he is cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with Chriſt;</hi> pleaſant ſights and ſounds work not upon him.</p>
            <p>Now for you in whom ſin lives and reigns, we have but heavy tidings to tell you: The Text layes a heavy burthen upon you: if it was the Goſpel that <hi>Paul</hi> preached, this Goſpel condemns you; <hi>you are dead, while alive:</hi> your right-eye that you will not pluck out, and your right-hand that you will not cut off, ſhall be the chief ſeat of your pain; there ſhall the fire begin, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ceaſe burning, and theſe ſhall be as fewel to burn the whole body: Out of theſe ſhall the worm that never dies, grow.</p>
            <p>And for you, Chriſtians, that are ſlack and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent, and not ſtrenuous and ſucceſsful in this work of Mortification; you mar your own mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies: it's this that renders you uncapable of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:103420:33"/>Comforts, and it's this that multiplies your ſorrows; you may be firſt in profeſſion, in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, and gifts, in doing of works of holineſs and righteouſneſs, and firſt and chief in ſufferings for the Goſpel; and yet be laſt in Gods reckoning, and leaſt in the Kingdom of heaven above: thou mayſt with much difficulty get through the Needles-eye, and through the ſtrait-gate, but thou loſeſt thy hundredfold here: and for any thing thou knoweſt, puts everlaſting life to a ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; you mar and blur this great evidence for Heaven in the Text; you cannot read your name in the Promiſe. If ſin be not your death, yet it blackens, lames, cripples and wounds you, and keeps you weak, and your Soul always a bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; any unmortified ſin marrs your freedom with God: it's like a weight upon the Soul, that thou cannot <hi>run thy Race,</hi> Heb. 12.1, 2. Or it's like a thorn in the foot: it's like a Wound in the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-hand, it leaves a print upon every Duty; any unmortified luſt brings on deadneſs and formali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and Duties are rather Ornaments, than meat and drink to the man. Or upon the bearing ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; It is hence that ſome real Chriſtians bear afflictions with more trouble and impatience than ſome others; afflictions wound our Idols, and theſe are as pieces of our ſelves: they are like <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> forked arrows ſtuck into our right-hand, or right-eye, we have a quick ſenſe of theſe: God would have us pluck out the eye, and let all go; or cut off the arm, and we ſhould not feel the arrow; but we pluck at the arrow, and tear our fleſh: What is it but our loathneſs to let our I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols go, that makes affliction bitter? It's not po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:103420:34"/>or want of Eſtates, Trading, Relations, that in themſelves afflict; for we ſee many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedly want theſe: but it's our unmortified cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, our inordinate love and deſire of theſe, this in leſs or more is common to ſome godly, with others. 2. The holy Lord doth by afflictions of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten bring forth mens ſecret unmortified luſts, and writes them on their foreheads, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.36, 37. Sometimes by the kind of their afflictions, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by their carriage under it. But 3. There is beſides this in the Believer, a quicker ſenſe and apprehenſion of Gods anger than in others, and this makes afflictions ſit the ſorer to them: Hence comes ſuch Complaints, as <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.1. This by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanders do not conſider, but obſerving their trouble, think it comes from the ſame cauſe that the trouble of others proceeds from. Ah! its our ſhort-comings in Mortification, that makes men confound us with others, that darkens our difference from the World, in every ſtate of life we are in: If under wants, we are perplexed and thoughtful as others; if we abound, we are vain, and frothy, and proud, and ſupercilious as others. This is the bane of many Profeſſors, for <hi>this the Name of God is ſpoke ill of;</hi> for this the imputed Righteouſneſs of Chriſt is reproached; for this, the Spirit in his in-dwelling and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings is reproached by the <hi>Rabſheka</hi>'s of the time: for this, Free-grace and Goſpel-faith are reviled: did we not put this ſword in our Enemies hand, they ſhould have no Weapon wherewith to fight againſt Truth or us: this may indeed wound us, though it wound not Truth: <hi>Reproach hath broken my heart,</hi> ſaith <hi>David;</hi> it would not have done
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:103420:34"/>ſo, had he not given occaſion for it. Our works does not juſtifie our Faith; the fruits of the Spirit are not manifeſt as the fruits of the fleſh are: our deeds are not ſo different from others, as our prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and profeſſion are different from theirs.</p>
            <p>Yet ſomething I muſt ſay for the encouragement of ſuch as are ſenſible of their defects and ſhort-comings in Mortification. 1. I muſt offer you <hi>Pauls</hi> Relief, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.25. for however ſucceſsful he was, yet the encouragement is ſuch as may ſerve every Soul that does heartily fight the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels of the Lord, though not ſo ſucceſſively: the poor Believer is often crying out as <hi>Eliſha</hi>'s ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, <hi>Maſter, What ſhall we do?</hi> But were our eyes open, we ſhould ſee more for us, than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us: <hi>the Father, the Son, and the Spirit,</hi> are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged too, through this bleſſed Work; ye have right to the ſame aid (if ye will but uſe it) that Chriſt had in his conteſt with, and conqueſt over <hi>principalities &amp; powers,</hi> Epheſ. 1.19, 20, ſo that our impotency can be no excuſe to us; Faith gives the Soul the greateſt reſemblance of Divine Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency. 2. Take that word, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1, You feel and know that there are many things condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in you; yea, enough to condemn millions of Men or Angels: But O the myſterious depths of Free-grace, that ſhould divide and ſeparate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Condemnable &amp; Condemnation. Indeed, the more Conſcience one makes of mortifying ſin, the more ſenſe and aſſurance of their Abſolution and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dempnity. If ſin be prevailing, it's hard to maintain the ſenſe of this; yet in ſome caſes one may: as when the Soul is under a deep afflicting ſenſe of prevailing-ſin, and ſolicitouſly ſtriving againſt it,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:103420:35"/>
               <hi>Pſal.</hi> 65.3, <hi>Iniquities prevail againſt me,</hi> &amp;c. You may yield to the Antecedent, and deny the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence: yea, you make the prevailing of ſin an Argument in prayer for Pardon, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 25.11. Thoſe ſame Iniquities that ſet Juſtice a-work, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.5. He can make an Argument for mercy, <hi>Gen.</hi> 8.21. Indeed, if one keep up any perſwaſion of their freedom from Condemnation, it's a great doubt if they can keep up the comfort of this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion too; for, theſe are often ſeparated. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> has his Abſolution, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.13, yet does he afterward beg the comfort and joy of it; or at leaſt a cloſer Application of it. 3. Know that oft-times Satan and Corruptions ſtir moſt where they have leaſt poſſeſſion, and real power; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that they make moſt ado, when they are neareſt to be caſt out.</p>
            <p>But if you enquire, why the holy Lord does ſuffer ſin to prevail ſo much over ſome of his own? I anſwer, The <hi>Captain of our ſalvation</hi> knows how to bring his followers to Glory; and he knows that it's better for ſome to be kept ſighting (even though often foiled) than to be Triumphing. The riſing of ſome is their falling, and the falling of others is their riſing; Succeſs is ſometimes worſe to carry under, than a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat; Pride and Self-righteouſneſs often get up upon our Trophies over ſin: and for this end ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Lord ſuffers ſome ſin to prevail: If he ſee a Soul enclining to eſtabliſh <hi>its own righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> Ezek. 33.13, <hi>If he truſt to his own righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and commit iniquity.</hi> Pride often riſes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ruins of other luſts: but thus the Lord ſuffers not the foot of Pride to get up, he keeps
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:103420:35"/>the Soul under a deep impreſſion of its exceeding ſinfulneſs and vileneſs; indeed, it is a trial to Faith, when the Soul ſees nothing in it ſelf, and yet can believe; and then is Faith pureſt, when others reckon upon themſelves as the worſt of Sinners. <hi>David</hi> reckons himſelf as a beaſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73: And he not only mourns for ſin, as a man; but he roars as it were like a pained beaſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.3. He ſeems fitter for a Wilderneſs to cry out, than for a ſecret Chamber to weep in: at other times he can <hi>water his couch in the night,</hi> now he <hi>roars all the day-long:</hi> at other times <hi>his moiſbure is dried,</hi> now <hi>his bones:</hi> the <hi>pillars of his houſe ſhake and wax old.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Thus the Lord lets the Soul ſee its need of conſtant ſupplies of Grace, and ſo keeps it in a cloſer dependence on himſelf: were we always vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious, we ſhould not know ſo well our own inſufficiency, nor the ſufficiency of Grace. Some are kept Cripples, becauſe they would either run away from him, or neglect him. It's evident, that we are oftneſt with God, when we have moſt need of him; how often does neceſſity prompt us to Duty, more than love, or conſcience of Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? hence we pray <hi>ſeven times,</hi> when we <hi>praiſe</hi> once.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Lord often puniſhes his people by this: letting them know the difference between Chriſts yoke, and ſins.</p>
            <p n="4">4. He manifeſts his power in their final Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, after ſo many foils: On this account <hi>Paul glories in his infirmities,</hi> 2 Cor. 12.9, 10: thus al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo he manifeſts the riches of his Grace. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the Soul from ſin to God, is a wonder
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:103420:36"/>of Free-grace; but the Converſion of ſome is a greater wonder. Mortification of ſin in any Soul is a marvellous work of the Spirit, but more mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous in ſome; where ſin was deeper rooted and more fortified, and where the name of luſts was begun: even ſo, the ſalvation of the moſt morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Soul, is a new wonder of Free-grace: but the ſalvation of ſome Souls, is a ſupereminent act of ſuperabounding-grace; the <hi>High-praiſes of God</hi> ſhall be in all their mouths: but the ſongs of ſome ſhall riſe higher than others: were not the holieſt ſo much in admiring how themſelves were ſaved, it might be an aſtoniſhment to them to ſee, may be, ſome in Heaven, whom in their thoughts they have ſometimes reprobated: how much ſin do ſome bring to Heavens-door with them? At Heavens-gate is the grave and burying-place of many ſtrong Corruptions: <hi>Death,</hi> which is <hi>the wages of ſin,</hi> is made the grave of ſin. And what the Red-ſea was to the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> theſe Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that keep poor Souls in bondage, and that ſtill purſue them, they ſhall ſee no more the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of your final Conqueſt. Is it not good news from a far Countrey, that the <hi>Captain of your ſalvation</hi> ſtands ingaged for you? and it is more his concern than yours, that you be victorious. And O what <hi>Hoſanna</hi>'s ſhall be ſung to him, when <hi>he ſhall ride in Triumph through the ſtreets of the new Jeruſalem that is above,</hi> with his triumphing followers, each having a <hi>Crown</hi> on their head, and <hi>Harp</hi> in their hand; his Conqueſt is a pledg of yours, <hi>John</hi> 16. You are often thinking that ſome day you will <hi>fall by the hand,</hi> &amp;c. You have had as good aid engaged to ſave you, as Chriſt
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:103420:36"/>had, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.19, 20: and you being ſo nearly united to him, he reckons not his Conqueſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat, as long as you are in a Militant ſtate: If you be fighting the good fight, Chriſt is upon his way to relieve and fetch you off victorious; Know you not that he has ſaid, <hi>I will that they be where I am?</hi> he knew his Truſt, and that it was the Fathers will; and well it is for us, it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends not on ours.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. What we have ſaid, does ſpeak ſadly to ſuch as either neglect this great Duty, on which the Text lays ſo much ſtreſs: or who think to mortifie ſin by meer moral means, or conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. For the firſt ſort: 1. There be ſome that inſtead of mortifying ſin, cheriſh and feed it, and make proviſion for it: that are in league with it, that have common Friends and common Foes with it: yea, to ſome it's as themſelves. It's as a <hi>right-hand,</hi> &amp;c. yea, it's their life; wound their luſts, and their heart dies: ſpeak to ſuch of Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and you may as eaſily, and more, perſwade them to ſtab, or at leaſt to lance themſelves. Hence men have found out ſo many counterfeits of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, they will rather kill thouſands of Rams and Bullocks, yea, their ſons and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, ere they ſlay ſin; What ſeverities have ſome uſed to themſelves, to ſave their ſins? What vaſt ſums have ſome given to redeem the life of their ſins? This hath enriched the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh and Prelatick Clergy, more than ever their own, or the Benefactors Piety or Zeal have done.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There be ſome that ſeem to be grieved with
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:103420:37"/>the power of ſin, that are daily poring upon their ſins, but never are able to come out of them; that are much in complaining of the power of ſin, but never able to mortifie ſin. Now here I ſhall ſhew 1. What it is that ordinarily hinders the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of ſin. 2. How it comes that convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Souls that are often complaining of ſin, yet take up ſhort of Mortification.</p>
            <p>For the former, let us conſider, 1. The frame and corrupt Habit of the mind of Man. There's in it Ignorance, Atheiſm, Inconſiderateneſs and Unbelief. Firſt, There's Ignorance, the <hi>god of this world hath blinded</hi> men: and then he makes them grind in his Mill. Sinners ſee no Enemy to fight with, they ſee no harm in ſin, they feel no ſting or poiſon in it: and inſtead of crucifying it, are apt to ſay, <hi>Why, what evil hath it done?</hi> for ſin is marvellouſly tame, where it's kindly uſed. It's Satans policy to teach men to call <hi>evil, good,</hi> and ſo to advance it: and to call <hi>good, evil,</hi> and ſo to perſecute it: thus we ſee him carry on the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of Holineſs. 2. There's Atheiſm: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be any ſpeculative Atheſm, I enter not upon. I am apt to think, that if there be a head-Atheiſm, it proceeds from heart-Atheiſm: But certain it is, that when men have blotted out all ſenſe of God upon their mind; ſenſe of ſin muſt needs be gone too (no doubt, it's from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valency of Atheiſm in theſe days, that ſome have denied any real difference between good and evil): did men live under the impreſſions of an infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly holy, juſt, ſoveraign Majeſty, they durſt not ſo affront his Law and Authority, nor maintain his Enemies, which he would have ſlain. 3. There
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:103420:37"/>is Inconſiderateneſs. Sinners do not count the coſt and charges of ſin: they ſee not the hook, the poiſon that is in it; conſider not what bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs it will be in the latter end, when they ſhall mourn at the laſt, &amp;c. <hi>Prov.</hi> 5.12. Many ſuffer more for it, even in this life, than the godly does for holineſs; but the latter end of it is another thing. Now what men have in Oblivion, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider not, or look upon at a great diſtance: To the godly man, Judgment and Eternity are near; therefore he deals with ſin, as he would do if he heard the laſt Trumpet, or ſaw the great <hi>white Throne ſet, and the Ancient of days ſitting upon it,</hi> &amp;c. 4. There's Unbelief; did men believe what evil were in ſin, what it is in its Nature and Effects, and Conſequents, their hearts would riſe with indignation againſt it; they would ſeek to extinguiſh their luſts and paſſions, as men do fire, when it breaks out in their houſes. Now the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainders of theſe are in the Regenerate.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There is the engagedneſs of the heart and affections to ſin: the heart is the chief ſeat and ſtrength of ſin. There's a heart-union between a Sinner and his Idols, ſuch as reſembles that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a Man and his Wife: hence, mens Idols are called <hi>their Lovers:</hi> and the back-ſliding of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors, is called <hi>Adultery and Whoredom;</hi> hence inſtead of killing their luſts, they love them, and cheriſh them as their own fleſh. To mortifie ſin, were to mortifie themſelves: Will a man ſlay the wife of his Boſom, the deſire of his Eyes, or thruſt through his intimate Friend? Sin is as meat and drink to them, they drink it as the Ox does water: It's as Air to breathe in, it's as ſpirits and
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:103420:38"/>blood to them; Kill me, ſays the Sinner, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain me from this or that: when we ſpeak a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſin, men take it, as if we ſpake againſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: when we cry out againſt ſin, it's to them, as if we were reproaching them: where the eyes are full of ſin, a man cannot ceaſe to ſin; much leſs when the heart is full of it: love does ſtrongly unite the heart to it; there's a League, a Covenant of friendſhip between the heart and ſin. Now ſin may in a ſort keep true to the man for a time, <hi>viz.</hi> while it is conceiving and grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but when it is perfected, it brings forth death. When one, as <hi>Ephraim,</hi> is joyned to Idols, there is little hope of him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There is the ſtrength of ſin: our Natures are leavened with ſin, not coloured with it: But ſin is like blood and ſpirits (as is ſaid); and as we grow up, ſin encreaſes and grows up, till at length we be wholly inſlaved to it. Sin is a great King: Pride, and Covetouſneſs, and Senſuality, are its three great Princes: each of them have millions of ſlaves. How many Kings and Princes, are but Lacqueys to the luſt of the Eye, or the Fleſh, or to the pride of Life. The greateſt Conquerors of the World have been in bondage to theſe: ſuch as affected the utmoſt ſoveraignty over men, have been abſolute ſlaves to their luſts: O the violence of mens luſts and paſſions! It's a hard task to vanquiſh thoſe uſurping Tyrants, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially where they have had long poſſeſſion; ſuch are too hard for a man to mortifie; the more ſtrength, and the longer poſſeſſion any ſin has had, the more difficulty to overcome it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. This proceeds from the deceitfulneſs of ſin,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:103420:38"/>and Satan; he often paints Sin in the colour of Virtue, and it eſcapes free; and he blackens Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and we ſtrike at it, and ſeek to mortifie it: Or ſometimes, when we are angry at ſin, it ſneaks away and couches in ſome corner: and when our anger is over, and the ſtrength of the Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which bred it, worn off, ſin comes forth again, and its peace is made, there's no more of it: yea, ſuch is the deceitfulneſs of ſin, that it can advance it ſelf by the want of tempting-Objects, as well as by the abounding of them. Hence, as the richer and higher ſome grow, Pride and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varice grows: So the poorer and the more deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſome grow, the more Pride (as appears in <hi>Achitophels</hi> caſe) and Covetouſneſs encreaſe. So Luſt oft-times grows moſt, where there be feweſt temptations to blow it up; It takes life upon the withdrawing of the Object (as the blaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or abſence of mens Idols often encreaſes their Idolatry with the memory of them): the want of the Object does feed Luſt more, than the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of it, as appears in <hi>Ammons waxing lean day by day, for love of his ſiſter;</hi> and aftewards <hi>how did he hate her?</hi> O the depths of Satan, and the cunning of Sin! how many policies does it uſe to preſerve it ſelf: it promiſes ſo fair, and ſmiles ſo upon a man, that he cannot find in his heart to ſlay it.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That which alſo hinders the mortification of it, is the ſuitableſs of it to our corrupted Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: there is ſomething in Applauſe, that gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifies that Self-exalting principle in man. Men find pleaſures ſweet, and they cannot but believe their ſenſes, before any teſtimony from without:
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:103420:39"/>they ſee, and feel, and taſte ſome ſenſible good in ſinful Objects: and it's hard to diſpute a man out of his Senſes. Nature craves ſomething, and the things of this World have ſome ſubſerviency and ſuitableneſs to Nature, in its pure primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Conſideration. And Sinners cannot now diſtinguiſh between purely Natural, and inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate deſires: and indeed the pleaſures of ſin are now as ſuitable to our corrupted Nature, as poor natural delights were ſuitable to <hi>Adam</hi> in Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency. Now look what pain it is to have Nature ſtarved or oppreſſed; ſuch pain it is to have ſin mortified.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The ſplendid Condition of ſome, and the merry life that Sinners lead, makes men in love with their way: they who deal moſt kindly with their ſin, and indulge and ſatisfie a proud and ſenſual diſpoſition, they live the gayeſt lives, and with their bluſtring Jollity they carry the voice, in the opinion of moſt men, who have no Sanctuary-light. As for Mortification, they think it diſpirits one, or makes a man a Mope; and that to mortifie ſin, is to mortifie all Pleaſure and Mirth.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Libertiniſm, or perverting of the grace of the Goſpel; ſome have doctrinally, and others practically, made that a Sanctuary for ſin, which God has made a City of Refuge for peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Sinners. Some think it improper to ſpeak to Believers of ſin, or mortification, at leaſt that we ſhould not to them preach againſt any ſins, but ſuch as argue them to be in a good ſtate (as there are ſome diſeaſes that argue a good conſtitution of Body) and that we ſhould urge love and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude only, and not Hell nor Wrath; but whoſe
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:103420:39"/>doctrine is the Text? and to whom is it directed? This pretended heat of Spirituality, has often iſſued into looſneſs and prophanity. This pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical Abuſe of Grace, is that wherein all unſound hearts do really conſpire. Antinomian, Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, and Ranting principles, are the moſt imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate inferences and concluſions that natural hearts draw from the doctrine of Free-grace; which, were not men ſtrangely byaſſed, and prejudiced by their luſts, may eaſily appear to be horrid perverſions of the Goſpel. Thus he that came to deſtroy ſin, is made the Saviour of ſin.</p>
            <p>For the ſecond Queſtion; Whence it is that ſome complain of the power of ſin, yet reſt in ſomething ſhort of the mortification of it? <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>. 1. Some are convinced of the power of ſin in them, and are troubled at it, but hope that Duties will weaken it, and wear it off; when alas, they never hurt it. Or, 2. That time will do it; that when temptations are over, and fewel withdrawn, luſts will die of themſelves: and that when they are got out from under ſuch and ſuch cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, Corruptions will not have ſuch ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage againſt them: when alas, ſin can live without temptations, and has fewel enough with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and can create temptations to it ſelf. Or, 3. Upon every inconſiderable reſiſtance to, or advantage againſt their ſin, they begin to hope well of themſelves: as <hi>Micah</hi> fooliſhly concludes that God will bleſs him, ſeeing he had a <hi>Levite to be his Prieſt;</hi> ſo do ſome dream of Heaven, upon every little ſucceſs againſt a temptation to ſin, or upon every paſſionate wiſh to be freed from ſin, as inconſiſtent with the hope of Heaven; though
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:103420:40"/>ſuch wiſhes do often grow out of Nature, and ſelf love. Or, 4. Such ſatisfie themſelves with meer complaints of ſin; trouble for ſin does ſometimes ſecretly harden in ſin, and iſſues in ſecure deſpair (as burning, though it be painful, yet it ſtops bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing); or elſe ſuch ſatisfie themſelves with ſome common Comfort, and are all on a ſudden as Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vial as ever; (There's a great deceit in folks com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out from under Soul-trouble) or if they can get ſome tears to bewail their ſins, theſe are to them as good a Plaiſter as Chriſts blood; O the deceitfulneſs of tears, when they are not the juyce of a broken heart: they do but water ſin, and make it more fruitful. Or finally, By their paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

               </gap> Complaints, they get the pity and prayers of others, and are well lik'd of, and look'd upon as the Mourners, and broken-hearted, whom our Lord has bleſſed: and the prayers and good-like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of others, does inſenſibly work them into a good opinion of themſelves.</p>
            <p>In the ſecond place, They deſerve Reproof, who think to mortifie Sin by their own endeavours, or by meer moral means: No endeavours no Duties, no conſideration of Sins oppoſition to, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtency with our happineſs, without the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Spirit, can mortifie any one Sin. The Apoſtles manner of urging this great Duty, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves a Remark: on the one hand, he will not have people think that the Spirit was to do all, and they to do nothing; or that they are to <hi>be meerly paſſive</hi> in the buſineſs of Mortification; <hi>If ye mortifie</hi> — and on the other hand: he will not have them think that there <hi>is any power in them</hi> to mortifie Sin, but that it is <hi>through the Spirit.</hi>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:103420:40"/>It is the Spirits ſpecial work: and hence we may be inſtructed, how to preſs all Goſpel-duties ſo, as to avoid <hi>Enthuſiaſm</hi> and <hi>Antinomianiſm</hi> on the one hand, and <hi>Arminianiſm</hi> on the other.

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 3. Of Exhortation; If you would eſcape the ſecond Death: if you deſire or hope to live with God, and to be eternally happy in the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of him; ſet about the mortification of ſin. 1. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal corruption muſt be mortified, the root of Sin muſt be killed: <hi>lay the ax to the root of the tree;</hi> one ſtroke at the Root will do more harm to the Tree, than many ſtrokes at the Boughs. In the Doctrinal part, I hinted at the neceſſity and uſefulneſs of this. I ſhall only now point a little at the way of mortifying the Body of Sin. 1. A through ſight and diſcovery of it is neceſſary: I do not mean, that any man can fathom or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the heghth and depth of it, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.9, <hi>Who can know it?</hi> Now the deceitfulneſs of the heart is but a branch of the corruption of it: It's
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:103420:41"/>a Myſterie that we cannot now unfold; yea, and without the Spirits teaching, we cannot have ſuch a diſcovery of it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.7. Some Heathens have ſeen, and bewailed it as their diſeaſe, which yet they thought curable by moral Habits: but they never ſaw it as ſin, nor in its deadly damning Nature; Nay, nor did ever any common work of the Spirit give ſuch a diſcovery of it, as is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to the mortification of it; the Hypocrite ſees no more of it, than what he thinks ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon work ſufficient to cure. Hence it is, that all ſuch as advance Nature, are depreſſers of Grace; and that ſuch as extenuate original Corruption, make no great buſineſs of Converſion. And <hi>e con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra</hi> — hence it is alſo, that we find not a Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite in all the Scripture, complaining of this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal Corruption, as we find <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>David</hi> do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7, and <hi>Pſalm</hi> 51. Now in order to this ſight of Sin, 1. Thou muſt be much in the ſtudy and obſervation of thine own heart, and of the ſecret motions of ſin there; they are ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to their own hearts, who may not find every ſin there, even ſuch as they never heard named: or as the gracious heart complies with ſuch Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as may be, it never heard to be ſuch; ſo does the corrupt heart encline to ſuch ſins as are not to be named; or upon the mention of every ſin there's ſome inward ſtirring to it, eſpecially if it be plauſibly ſpoke of. 2. Study the ſpirituality of the Law; there thou mayſt ſee the holineſs of God, which will not admit of the Ieaſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Sin: and there alſo thou mayſt read thine own Impurity and ſinful Impotency. 3. Seek the Spirits light, it's the Spirits work to diſcover Sin:
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:103420:41"/>let it be thy Souls deſire, that he would open ſome door or window, and let thee ſee more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, greater and greater Abominations, and what is doing in the ſecret Chambers of the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery of thy heart; and when thou haſt diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the depths of Sin, and the exceeding ſinfulneſs of in-dwelling ſin, ſit down and bewail thy felf, and mourn over it. And alas, <hi>two months</hi> will not ſufficiently bewail it, <hi>Judg.</hi> 11.37, <hi>Thy ſeventy</hi> or <hi>fourſcore years</hi> are too few for thee to go up and down the Mountains with thy Companions. Now godly ſorrows break the heart of Sin; tears that are ſqueezed and wrung from a man, and that come only from ſome inward Compunction, and pricking of the heart, may fortifie and feed Sin; but when they are the juice of a broken heart, or flow from a contrite heart, that is melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed down by the heavenly warmth of Divine love, they ſtifle and extinguiſh Sin. Sin can dwell with fear and horror, for theſe are the native fruits and products of it: and when Sin ſhall be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected in Hell, ſo ſhall theſe: but it cannot bear with godly ſorrow, nor can this ſorrow tolerate it; or it ſtrikes at the root and fundamental evil of Sin.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Cheriſh Grace in the heart: the two in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward principles of Grace and Sin work upon one another, as Fire and Water: Sin is like a ſtrong malignant humour in the Body. Now the way to expel it, is to corroborate and help Nature in its operations: as the New man grows up, he wears off the Old out of doors; <hi>Put on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and be <hi>cloathed with humility, love, long-ſuffering, mercy and brotherly-kindneſs; and pride, anger, wrath, malice will vaniſh away:</hi> See <hi>Col.</hi> 3.5,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:103420:42"/>6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 13; as Light comes in, Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs goes out. Bend a crooked ſtick ſtreight, and its crookedneſs is gone: Grace and Sin are alway acting againſt other, and no Conflict can be long in equal terms; either Grace or indwelling Sin is upon the growing hand: Vivification and Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification (the two parts of Sanctification) do ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance equally.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Obſerve and trace every Sin, and run it up to the heart, from whence it had its riſe: then drag your heart before the Lord, and cry, Lord here's the Atheiſt, the Unbeliever, the Murmurer, the injurious perſon, here's the Rebel and the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient perſon. The poor Believer, even many times would tear his heart in pieces, and is ready to ſay, Except I had a better heart, I would I had none; had I only drunk Poiſon, I might be piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: but when the <hi>poiſon of Aſps</hi> is in my Nature, I deſerve to be abhorred: did I hide the Lords Enemy in my houſe only, I were a Traytor to him; much more, when I hide and nouriſh Sin in my heart. Bring the <hi>body of death</hi> before Gods Tribunal, and cry for Judgment againſt it: and ſay, Lord, here's thine and mine Enemy: life for life, and blood for blood.</p>
            <p n="4">4. If thou wouldſt mortifie Original Sin, thou muſt be ſure to mortifie <hi>Self;</hi> for ſelfiſhneſs is the ſoul of Sin. This is the great Idol that all others truckle under: Mans firſt ſin was ſelf-exaltation, and ſelf-ſatisfaction; and that depravation of our Nature, which is the puniſhment of this firſt Sin, does moſtly appear in our ſelf-willing, ſelf-loving, ſelf-ſeeking, ſelf-pleaſing. The Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral man beholds himſelf, apprehends ſome excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:103420:42"/>in himſelf; believes himſelf, loves him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, pleaſes himſelf, deſigns himſelf, and that as his laſt end, wherein he reſts. Hence the firſt ſtep of our recovery to God, is ſelf denying, ſelf-a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſing, ſelf-loathing, ſelf-annihilating; and the lower ſelf be, the weaker is the body of Sin: the more a man is emptied of ſelf, and dead to ſelf; the more he is filled with the fulneſs of God, and alive to God. When Chriſt is all, and Grace is all, the Old-man and indwelling Sin are at the lower ebb; when ſelf is nothing, and Chriſt is all the mans light and life: All, to the Judgment, heart and affections; all the mans wiſdom, all his righteouſneſs, all his ſanctification, all his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, and all his ſtrength, this ſtabs Sin at the heart. <hi>Arminians</hi> and <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> no wonder, they oppoſe the doctrine of Original Sin; for their principles, as they are the very iſſue of the body of Sin, ſo they feed and cheriſh it. Self-exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion has begot their Tenets, and they honour and advance Self as their Father.</p>
            <p n="5">5. As Self is the ſoul of this body of Sin, ſo Pride, Worldlineſs, and Voluptuouſneſs are the chief members of it: <hi>the lust of the eye, and of the fleſh, and the pride of life,</hi> are, as it were, the head and heart of the body of Sin: a wound in theſe is deadly; mortifie theſe radical luſts, and you mortifie the body of Sin: knock down pride, and you daſh out the brains of Sin. Bring the fleſh under a due ſubjection unto the Spirit, ſo that it bear no ſway, nor act any thing againſt the Government and intereſt of Chriſt in the Soul, and you wound the heart, and ſtop the breath of this Body of Sin.</p>
            <pb n="78" facs="tcp:103420:43"/>
            <p>This leads us to a ſecond Branch of the Text, <hi>viz.</hi> To mortifie your moſt prevailing luſts: your Idol-ſins, which your Condition, Calling, or cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances do often expoſe you to. And O what a hard task is this, conſidering what the power of Sin is in ſome! (as I have formerly ſhewn) what intereſt it has got in them: in their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, their heart and affections, that it often en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gages them in open rebellion againſt God to maintain it: yea, ſome to wiſh that there were no God, and no Law to oppoſe it. What vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous reſiſtance do ſome make, to all thoſe means that God uſes to diſcover and deſtroy Sin? Sin has ſtrong Holds in the mans heart: every mans Idols are fortified with Walls and Bulwarks in his boſom, and O what ado is there to ſtorm them; for the Old man is watchful, and cannot be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized: hardneſs of heart is the Armour of Hell, wherewith ſinners beat back the ſtrokes of word and Providences; they will give up any thing, ere they will give up their Idol-ſin; they'l cry out of any thing, ere they ever name Sin; they will be beaten to powder, ere they be beat from Sin. Hence that's the doom of many, they are joyned to Idols, let them alone: be it unto you, even as you will: you will not forſake Sin, let it bear you company for ever.</p>
            <p>Are there not ſome here, who never gave a harſh word, nor an angry look to their Idols, who never ſpent half an hour in this war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare with Sin? the ſtrong-man reigns in them, and he keeps watch and ward, and guards every paſs: and none go out, or come in without his leave: every Moral or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:103420:43"/>action, every thought and word, pays Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom, Toll and Tribute to him. Now, 1. I ſhall ſhew you what are the prejudices the Soul ſuſtains by every predominant luſt. 2. What are the advantages that come by mortifying theſe Sins. 3. I ſhall ſhew by what means ſuch Sins may be mortified.</p>
            <p>For the firſt, If you be under the prevalency of any Sin, you will never be free of fear and doubts; you make the iſſue of your war with Sin doubtful. It's but rare, that one under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valency of any Corruption, can take any comfort in that word (or the like), <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.20, <hi>And the God of peace,</hi> &amp;c. you fight but <hi>dubio morte.</hi> What the Apoſtle ſaith of not advancing in god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.9; We may ſay of ſuch as do not vigorouſly carry on the mortification of every Sin, <hi>He that lacketh theſe things, is blind, and cannot ſee afar off, and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old ſins</hi> (It's ſad, when any Sin is ſo far re-inforced, that a man forgets how bitter once it was to him, and how he was gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly delivered from it, and can ſee little diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between his unregenerate and regenerate ſtate): Sin puts out a mans eyes, and ſtops a mans ears, that he cannot ſee the Land that is afar off, nor can he <hi>hear the voyce of joy and gladneſs,</hi> Pſalm 51.8. Such a man can ſee no more through the Promiſes, than if they were ſtone-walls; any prevailing Sin clips the wings of Faith, that when it's ſent out, it returns not with one <hi>Olive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaf</hi> in its mouth. Scarch and ſee, if it be not ſome prevailing Sin, ſome carnal intereſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croaching upon Chriſts intereſt in your Soul, that
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:103420:44"/>ſills you with fears: It's the nature of Sin to breed fear and trouble; and the Lords Evangelick Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice requires that ye ſhould taſte of the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſin, and of the fruit of your doings. Should he ſpeak comfortably to you, when not only your warfare is not accompliſhed, but you are in league with ſome Enemy of his? Nay, he will write bitter things againſt you: if you will not do juſtice upon your Idols, they ſhall coſt you dear: if when the lot is fallen upon them, you refuſe to caſt them over-board, you may row hard, but you ſhall never come to ſhore; the wind ſhall encreaſe, and the ſea ſhall work and be tempeſtuous. Where is the man or woman a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt you, that is not under ſome rebuke from the Lord? let them ſtand forth? Is there no gall nor wormwood in your Cup? are there no bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken bones amongſt you, nor teeth with Gravel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtones? Are none of the arrows of his Quiver en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into your Reins? Are there none whoſe Soul is filled with trouble, and removed far from peace, and are feeding upon affliction and miſery? Do you not know how to father your Afflictions? how long ſhall it be, ere you will avenge your ſelves upon your Idols, ere you will pluck out the Dart that wounds you, and that keeps you bleeding? Will you not do juſtice upon the <hi>Achan</hi> that troubles Iſrael? Come to God, and bring with you words, and ſay, I have ſinned, what ſhall I do unto thee, &amp;c? I can make no amends, but I'le be avenged on my Idols for my <hi>two Eyes,</hi> and <hi>two hands,</hi> and for all the trouble they have cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to me.</p>
            <p>You will ſay, 1. Are not ſome under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valenty
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:103420:44"/>of ſome ſin, and yet have more freedom from fears and doubts, than ſome that are more mortified than they? I Anſwer, Some mens peace is their plague, at leaſt their puniſhment; and the ſolicitous fears of ſome, are their mercy, and help to keep them awake: it's better to be in a Fever, than in a Lethargy. 2. There is ſome peace and comfort that flows from the death of ſin, and the encreaſe of holineſs, by way of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral reluctancy and emergency; and there's ſome trouble that flows from ſin by the ſame natural neceſſity: ſure the more of the former, the more peace; and the more of the latter, the more trouble: and if the wicked be as the troubled Sea, ſure the more that ſin work, the more trouble there will be. 2. There is ſome inward peace that follows Mortification by way of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, over and above what naturally follows from it, as that which comes by the Teſtimony of the Spirit, &amp;c. and the more that ſin be mortified, ordinarily the more of this; the more you walk according to the law of the New Creature, the more peace ſhall be upon you: ſo that there is ſome trouble that is the puniſhment of unmorti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied ſin, over and above what it naturally breeds; and ordinarily, the more lively that any ſin be, the more trouble and ſorrow in the Soul, and the more of Hell here, except the Conſcience be ſeared, or the Soul be ſmitten with ſtupidity as a greater plague. Indeed, as ſometimes Gods comforts do not keep peace with our meaſure of Mortification, but ſometimes exceeds it: ſo ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times one that is not habitually ſo much under ſin as another, may yet have more inward trouble.</p>
            <pb n="82" facs="tcp:103420:45"/>
            <p n="2">2. Is the greatneſs of outward trouble an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of the ſtrength of ſin, or the livelineſs of any luſt? Do not we ſee, that the moſt mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, are often moſt afflicted? I anſwer, It's hard taking the meaſure of ones Mortification, and to judg how anothers heart ſtands affected to this, or that: One may be in great meaſure dead to pleaſures or worldlineſs in the groſs ſenſe, and yet alive to ſome near Relations: and one may be dead to the deareſt Friend, and yet alive to ſome ſpiritual luſt, may be, ſpiritual pride in gifts or graces, &amp;c. Or if the man be dead to theſe, yet may he be too much alive to ſpiritual comforts: I do not ſay, that the Lord would have the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever content to lie under the impreſſions of wrath (much leſs content to be damned), but he would have the man lie at his feet under cheſe, and bear witneſs to his holy Juſtice, when under outward or inward troubles. Now the more ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual mens ſins be, and the more refined theſe luſts are, they are the more provoking. 2. As the ſins of Believers are in ſome reſpect more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ſinful than the ſins of others: ſo the more grace one have, his ſin is proportionably aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated. <hi>Moſes</hi> ſuffers more for a word, than ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others for deeds. 3. As afflictions are Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant-mercies, and fruits of fatherly affections to all the children of God, ſo the more dutiful any child of God be, the greater may his Corrections be when he does fault, and ſo God is moſt gracious to him; yet the more a man tolerate any ſin, if he be not more afflicted than others, there's at leaſt more anger in his afflictions, which is the ſoul and ſpirit of afflictions, or the more ſpiritual
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:103420:45"/>are his puniſhments. Finally, The reaſon why ſome eminently godly are under many outward afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, may be, becauſe they have ſome time or other (may be) diſhonoured God by ſome publick ſin, whether before or after converſion: and as they are provoking to God, and ſcandalous to others, ſo he manifeſts greater ſeverity on ſuch; this is plain in <hi>Davids</hi> caſe, ſo that it's ſtill ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortified ſin that brings on trouble.</p>
            <p>A ſecond prejudice that comes by the preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of any Corruption, it keeps the Soul lean and low, and makes it a Cripple in Duties: it not only mar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Confidence and Chearfulneſs in Duties, but diligence and activity alſo, for theſe may be ſeparated: yea, it inſenſibly hardens the heart. What a fearful ſecurity and ſtupidity brought on ſin upon <hi>David?</hi> Where was <hi>Davids</hi> tenderneſs now, when he can plot <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riahs</hi> death? it's as ſickneſs to the Soul; for ſin is the Souls diſeaſe that does enervate its ſtrength, and make it languiſh. What is ſaid of <hi>whoredom</hi> and <hi>wine,</hi> is true of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſin: they take away the heart, yea, and the hand too; the man, as he is like a ſilly Dove, without heart, he cannot behave himſelf a right in Gods preſence, ſo he cannot ſpeed at Gods work, for he works <hi>cum laeſis facultalibus,</hi> his foul hands blackens holy Duties, his fingers drop much ſin upon them: the <hi>old man</hi> leaves the print of his heels upon them. O, what is it that keeps you out of Heaven, at leaſt from ſeeing it afar off! it's ſome ſin that beſets you, and hinders your motion Heaven-ward: how few paces have you advanced for theſe many days, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.1, 2? Whence is it, that you ſee not ſo much as the top
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:103420:46"/>of the Towers of the <hi>new Jeruſalem?</hi> How come many that did begin after you, yet to get before you? ſome weight preſſes you down: ſome cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt affection, like a long-garment, entangles you, or you ſtumble and fall often in the way. It is not ſo much external Duties, as the ſecret exerciſe of Mortification, that keeps grace lively; and when this is neglected, and any ſin prevails, Grace wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and often the Lord blaſts a mans gifts al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo; or, if gifts be intire, they are left for a ſhare, as <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 2.9. It was <hi>Solomons</hi> ſnare, that when he was purſuing vanity; <hi>My wiſdom remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with me</hi> (ſays he): It is the Curſe of many this day, and that which hardens them in their ill way, that their Gifts and Learning rémain with them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Think what loſs of Communion with God, you ſuſtain by your Idol, or your unmortified corruption. <hi>Sampſons Delilah</hi> coſt him his two Eyes, his Liberty, and at length his Life: But the departing of <hi>the Spirit of the Lord</hi> was the ſaddeſt of all; by letting the king of your luſts live (as <hi>Saul</hi> did <hi>Agag</hi>) you hazard your Crown of Glory, at leaſt you have little of Heaven up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth. Tell me, Chriſtian, when was you laſt in Heaven? it may be, not for many days: and know you not, what keeps you out? It's a ſad word, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 14.5, <hi>They are all eſtranged from me through their idols:</hi> Iſa. 59.2, <hi>Your iniquities have ſeparated betwixt you and God, and your ſins have hid his face from you:</hi> yea, and often-times prevailing-ſin does blot out the impreſſion; and ſometimes the remembrance of that ſolacing ſweetneſs that the Soul had in his Company,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:103420:46"/>begets ſome ſatisfaction in this dreadful ſtate of diſtance from God; thy Idols of Jealouſie ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate thee from thy chief Friend; by this means thou wears out thy intimacy, if not thy Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance: may be, thou makeſt not a viſit to Heaven in many days: and if the Lord at any time come to thee, thou art not at leiſure, but buſied, entertaining thy Idols. Ah! have you no ſenſe of theſe things? I need not tell you what's the mournful moan and ruful complaint of many Souls: Ah! it was well with me till ſuch a time. O, how many good days had I? what a Heaven upon Earth had I? what Communion with God in Prayer, in the Lords Supper, and other Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, till I did begin to dally with ſuch an Idol, till ſuch a Corruption began to get power of me: but ſince thou intermitted the vigorous exerciſe of Mortification, where are thy Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phies and Triumphs? where are thy <hi>Bethels,</hi> thy <hi>Penuels,</hi> thy <hi>Eben-ezers?</hi> And it's well for thee if ever thou recover this. Diſtance from God and indiſpoſition to Duty, grows more in one day than thou canſt make up, or wear out in many. I doubt, if ever <hi>Davids</hi> bones were as ſound as before; if ever he had ſuch Joy and glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in Gods Company, in the Sanctuary, or elſewhere, as before; or that ever God appeared to <hi>Solomon,</hi> as he had done twice before his fall. I doubt, the holy Lord deals with many of his people in this life, as he did with the <hi>Levites,</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zek. 14.44, who had gone aſtray from him af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their Idols: they were to be keepers of the charge of the Houſe for the ſervice thereof (as keeping the Gates, and ſlaying the Sacrifices),
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:103420:47"/>
               <hi>but they ſhall bear their iniquity, and they ſhall not come near unto me, to do the office of a Prieſt unto me: nor come near to any of my holy things, in the moſt holy place,</hi> &amp;c. See <hi>ver.</hi> 11.12, 13, 14: He will not put thee out of doors, yet may never let thee come where thou haſt been, and never ſet thee ſo high on this ſide of Eternity.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Any Idol or unmortified luſt will clip the wings of Prayer, and intercept the return of it, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59.1, 2, <hi>The Lords hand is not ſhortned, nor his ear heavy,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 14.3, 4, and 20, 31, <hi>As I live, ſaith the Lord, I will not be enquired,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 66.18, <hi>If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me:</hi> the man that has his Idols ſet up in his heart, he <hi>grieves the Spirit</hi> who helps our infirmities in Prayer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> if he has any pleaſure in <hi>approaching</hi> to God, yet he has no pleaſure <hi>in God:</hi> he comes not to him as his exceeding Joy, though may be, he cannot paſs evening and morning without ſaluting him in a formal complementing way, in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as men uſe to many they care not for: and indeed many know no other uſe of their prayers, than of their formal Salutes and Complements, <hi>viz.</hi> to keep fair terms with ſuch as they care little for; yet are not willing to diſoblige. Is it any wonder that God regard not ſuch prayers? any unmortified ſin ſhuts Heaven, and lays an Arreſt upon the profit of thy Duties: there's no profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table trading between the Soul and Heaven, there's no profiting by Means or Ordinances: if thou would loſe the Arreſt, mortifie thy ſin, give up thy Idol, caſt over board thy <hi>Jonah</hi>'s: If thou haſt any ſuit depending before the Throne
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:103420:47"/>of Grace; if in the mean while thou offend God, or grieve his Spirit, thou art like to loſe thy cauſe; who will provoke the Judg when his cauſe is before him? Hence that word, <hi>Deut.</hi> 23.9, <hi>When thou goeſt forth againſt thine Enemies, then keep thee from every wicked thing.</hi> When a man has ſome ſpecial dependance on God, and has ſome ſpecial expectation from him, it's unſeaſonable <hi>then</hi> to provoke him to Jealouſie.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Think what thou wouldſt do in a dying day: how will you look upon your Idols? What will you do in the day of Viſitation? where will you hide your glory? How would you look upon a Temptation, or upon the tempting Objects of your darling luſts: all your ſweet morſels, and ſtollen waters, will then be bitter; but the more ſweetly any ſin went down, the bitterer will it be when it comes up again: may be, your Idols and you were pleaſant in your lives, but they are ſad Company in the valley of Death: Can the <hi>Camel go through the Needles-eye?</hi> nay, if there were no more to hinder but the bunch upon his back, he could not; Can you <hi>go through the ſtrait gate?</hi> if there were no more but one unmortified luſt, you cannot, Can you think to leap into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, warm and ſmoaking with ſin; as many times you come to ſpeak with God, when the laſt word you ſpoke was with your Idol? Can you ſing that ſweet triumphant Song, <hi>O Death, where is thy ſting! O Grave, where is thy victory!</hi> 1 Cor. 15.55? For lo, here ſin that <hi>is the ſting of death,</hi> and the victory of the Grave, ſticks in thee; when o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſhall be ſinging <hi>Hallelujah,</hi> and <hi>harping with Harps.</hi> Death is no dark ſhade to the Son of
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:103420:48"/>Righte ouſneſs, having lightned it, by his paſſing through it; thou ſhalt be little better than the Hypocrite, whom fearfulneſs ſurprizeth, &amp;c. If the Maſter knock, when thou art either aſleep, or waſting his goods, or eating and drinking <hi>with the drunken,</hi> thou will be afraid to go down and open; he muſt break open the gates if he get in: O what ſad work will any living luſt make, when thou comes to die!</p>
            <p>Let us now mention a few advantages you ſhall have by the mortification of ſin, eſpecially your moſt potent ſin: 1. The mortification of your moſt predominant luſt, will be a great evidence to you of your ſincerity, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 18.23, <hi>I was alſo upright before him,</hi> &amp;c. When any luſt is ſtrong, or when any Idol has a great intereſt in the Soul, the heart is as 'twere divided: and then cannot know whether Chriſts intereſt, or its, prevails, and bears moſt ſway in the Soul: but where there is no competition, the caſe is clear; when one can ſay, If any thing interfere with Chriſt, it's this: If any thing render my caſe ſuſpicious, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench upon Sincerity, it's this Corruption, this Idol; But ſure I am, this is ſo far under, that it cannot diſprove my integrity; when the Lord tryes his peoples ſincerity, he uſes to hit their ſore, to prove them in their Idols: (indeed, when he intends to diſcover their weakneſs, he puts them to tryal in the grace they excel moſt in; as <hi>Peter</hi> in his Courage, <hi>Moſes</hi> in his Meekneſs); if thou can deny thy ſelf in this; if thou can offer up thy <hi>Iſaac;</hi> hereby thou mayſt know thou fears God, and that thou loves God. Now the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of this fills the Soul <hi>with exceeding Joy,</hi>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:103420:48"/>2 Cor. 1.12. O the ſweet Calm it brings in, it's better felt than can be told: whereas the preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of any Corruption, deprives you both of the Teſtimony of the Spirit of God, and of your own ſpirit.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If thou can mortifie thy predominant luſt, thou may with the more eaſe mortifie other Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions: Commonly, all a mans luſts are made ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient to ſome one (though indeed ſometimes they thwart, as pride and covetouſneſs, pride and ſenſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, or covetouſneſs and ſenſuality), if you can kill that, the greateſt difficulty in Mortification is over: if you can take the ſtrong City, all the Villages and Countrey about will be ſubject to you. If <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liah</hi> be ſlain, the <hi>Philiſtins</hi> will fly: may be you complain of many things, and innumerable evils compaſs you about: but ſee if ſome one unmor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified Corruption do not maintain them all, and you cannot conquer theſe, till you have ſubdued that which ſets theſe on work, and which feeds and recruits them: this would eaſe you of many evils you complain of; the cutting off one mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ſin, will weaken the Body of ſin: they are ſo united, that it will make all the other members of ſin to languiſh, and does help on to a through Conqueſt.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Conſider, that there is more real ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in mortifying luſts, than in making proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for them, or in fulfilling them: There's more true pleaſure in croſſing and pinching our fleſh, than in gratifying it; were there any true plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in ſin, Hell would not be Hell: for the more ſin, the more Joy; you cannot ſatisfie one luſt, if you would do your utmoſt, and make your
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:103420:49"/>ſelf never ſo abſolute a ſlave to it; you think if you had your hearts deſire, you would be at reſt; you much miſtake: they had it, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 78.29, but yet they were not eſtranged from their luſts, <hi>ver.</hi> 30. How many a man, in the fulneſs of his ſufficiency, is yet in pain for more? <hi>Job</hi> 20.22? O, but the mortification of that ſin, makes a Jubiles, in the Soul; Who are they that ſing Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs here, and ſet up Trophies of Victory, and divide the ſpoils, when others are living under troubles <hi>without and within,</hi> and have their Soul removed far from peace? who ſhall wear <hi>Crowns on their heads</hi> in Heaven, and <hi>Palms in their hands,</hi> and have <hi>High-praiſes in their mouths,</hi> but they who turn the Battel to the Gate, who have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come their Enemies? Would you be able to ſing a Triumph, even when drawing your laſt breath? See what's the Tune, what's the matter and the ground of <hi>Pauls</hi> Song, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8: and with what a Tranſport of Spirit he ſings it; (as on the other hand it tells us, that it's faint or unſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful warring with ſin, that makes men unmeet to die). He goes in at the Gates of Heaven with flying Colours, and has an abundant Entrance miniſtred unto him; how much more will it make a man <hi>joy in Tribulation?</hi> It's ſome unmortified Corruption that makes the Croſs heavy, that makes a man uneaſie under affliction or ſuffering. O, what Duſt will a lively luſt raiſe? what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion and combuſtion in the Soul? When the hand of God falls heavy upon a Man while he is dandling ſome Idol, or purſuing ſome carnal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, the man is out of meaſure amazed; every unmortified Corruption makes even the thoughts
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:103420:49"/>and apprehenſions of trouble, full of horrour: and no wonder, for it's fearful when <hi>God comes to take vengeance on mens inventions,</hi> even when he <hi>forgives their iniquity.</hi> It's true in ſuch caſes, when the Lords people are meeting with trouble from men for his ſake, he makes not his quarrel viſible; he often ſcourges their Conſcience, when he does not viſibly contend with them, (and one laſh from his hand, is ſorer than <hi>Pauls</hi> 39 from the <hi>Jews):</hi> indeed, he ſometimes ſuſpends his quarrel, when he does not bury it. And ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Adverſaries wrath does as it were mitigate his, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.27. Now a mortified man cannot be moved by any thing: If there be no luſt alive, no trouble or affliction can come wrong.</p>
            <p>In the next place, let me offer you ſome Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections how to carry on the mortification of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing Corruption.</p>
            <p>And firſt in general, Get a clear ſight of your ſin, or elſe you cannot level your ſtrokes at it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right: be content that God ſhould by his Word and Spirit, light upon your Idol, and wound it. And if any man will tell you of ſin, your Enemy, count him thy Friend; ſay as <hi>Saul</hi> to the <hi>Ziphites,</hi> when they told him where <hi>David</hi> was, <hi>Bleſſed are you of the Lord, for you have had compaſſion on me,</hi> 1 Sam. 23.20, 21: that which you can leaſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure a Reproof for, is your Maſter-ſin; as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, that which you are moſt partial in, ſeek moſt to cover or excuſe, which you wiſh were no ſin, and are readieſt to pardon your ſelf for, or elſe are moſt ſorrowful when it cannot be diſpenſed with, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.21, 22: that ſin which riſes and goes to bed with you; which
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:103420:50"/>haunts you when alone, or in Company; when in your ſhops, and in your Cloſets, which you are at the greateſt toil for, which you do or ſuffer moſt for; that is the ſin, that like <hi>the man of ſin,</hi> 2 Theſſ. 2.8, <hi>exalts it ſelf.</hi> O look to Heaven, and ſee what work it made there: how ſin caſt ſo many Angels out of their firſt <hi>habitations,</hi> and thruſt them into <hi>chains:</hi> thoſe evil Spirits that now ſolicite thee to ſin, are dreadful Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of the miſchief of ſin: it's a wonder they have a face to tempt to ſin; it's as if Murtherers hung up in Chains, ſhould ſolicite Men to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Look to Paradiſe, and ſee what deſolation it made there; it had almoſt in a moment ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the whole Creation. Look to <hi>Golgotha,</hi> or <hi>Mount Calvary,</hi> or the Garden, and ſee what ſad work it made there, Look into Hell, and hear what a howling it has raiſed there! Alas, we paint it, and then play with it as Children do with painted Lions: And when thou has ſeen it, then thou cryes out, O the exceeding ſinfulneſs of ſin, and of my ſin! And let one ſin ſet thee in queſt of more: but never think thou ſees all thy ſins, nor all the evil that is in any one ſin: O, comply with the Spirit, and do not defeat his firk Work, which is Conviction; and when thou has ſeen thy ſore, hold thy finger upon it, and cry to him who is the ſoveraign Phyſician of Souls, to make inciſion there: cut off this hand or foot that gangrenes; yet keep not both thy eyes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, leſt it ſhould overwhelm thee with hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Get your hearts broken for Sin: your hearts are as fallow-ground; you cannot pluck up
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:103420:50"/>your thorns; they muſt be plowed up; you muſt rub and reinſe your Souls ſeven times in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Marah,</hi> in tears of godly ſorrow, ere thy Leproſie die; but ſee thy tears bathe not ſin, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of drowning it: and beware thy throws go not off, when thou art even about to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from it: it's a token of the ſtrength of ſin, the Soul is at a low ebb, when trouble for ſin is gone, when ſin has made its peace again. Some mens troubles do not kill ſin, but only break ſome bone of it, which when healed again, is ſtronger than before: therefore when thou has got a Nail faſtned into the Temples of the <hi>old man,</hi> or into the heart of the <hi>body of death,</hi> drive it to the head; when the Spirit brings home any word, and ſmites Sin, follow home the blow, and endeavour to maintain the warmneſs of that word, and the power of it upon thy Spirit, till thy Soul be drench'd with tears of Contrition, till thy heart be melted, and the droſs go away.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If thou would mortifie Sin, thy heart muſt be filled with diſtaſte of it: thy ſorrow muſt be attended with hatred, and this ſeeks the life of Sin; this will make a man defile the covering of his graven-Images of Silver, and the Ornament of his molten-Images of Gold; nothing leſs will ſerve thee than the death of thy Sin, thou wilt purſue it in thy ſelf and others: as <hi>Haman</hi>'s ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred ſought <hi>Mordecai</hi>'s life, yea, and the life of all the <hi>Jews</hi> for his ſake. Hide not thy Idols, as <hi>Rachel</hi> ſate upon hers: ſearch thy heart and thy way, that thou may find all out; and what thou canſt not find, pray, the Lord may find for thee, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39.34: leave no Corruption which Satan may
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:103420:51"/>fit and brood upon. Theſe things muſt needs be previous to Mortification.</p>
            <p>Now more particularly for the means of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on this great buſineſs of Mortification. 1. Prayer, eſpecially private Prayer, is of ſingular uſe (I mention only this at preſent, not being ſolicitous of Method): I ſay, private Prayer; for, your ſecret Sins and particular Corruptions may ſhelter, and ſhroud, and hide themſelves from all your prayers in publick, or in fellowſhip with others (and alas, many who are others mouths to God, have enough to do to mortifie pride, and vanity, and ſelfiſhneſs in praying with others: let it be, by their prayers to get other Corruptions mortified, or to get pride and ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſhneſs in other things mortified): Prayer, and Luſts, or Corruptions, are like <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malekites:</hi> when <hi>Moſes</hi> hands are up, <hi>Iſrael</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails: when they fall down, the <hi>Amalekites</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, ſo is it in this caſe. It was <hi>Pauls</hi> Relief, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7, 8: when Satan was working on the remainder of ſome Coruption: <hi>For this, I beſought the Lord thrice,</hi> and he was helped. It may be, ſenſe of ſome prevailing Corruption has ſent you to your Cloſet, and put you upon your knees: and you have found Relief, and then you have leſt off praying, and your Corruption has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed again. Hence, after the Apoſtle has arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Chriſtian for his Conflict, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6. He adds, <hi>ver.</hi> 18, <hi>Praying always with all prayer and ſupplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perſeverance;</hi> Set-times for Prayer, are as neceſſary as conſtant Set-meals of meat for the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: How often, I determine not; the feweſt we find,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:103420:51"/>is twice a day, Morning and Evening: <hi>Daniel</hi> prayed thrice a day; yet it is not right, when we limit our ſelves to times, were it ſeven times a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day. We find <hi>Daniel,</hi> Chap. 9.1, 2, ſetting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to pray, as if his three times a-day had been nothing. There are ſpecial Occaſions that call for more fervent praying, as our Lord conflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Garden, and being in an Agony, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thrice: and prayed yet more fervently. Now this is a ſpecial ſeaſon, when attached by any Corruption, we ſhould ſound an Alarm to Prayer, and let every Prayer be as an Arrow ſhot againſt Sin: and never think thou prays to any purpoſe, but when thou wounds ſome Corruption. O, but blunt Prayers will never draw blood of ſin: nor will ſleepy prayers hurt ſin; therefore thou muſt <hi>watch unto Prayer,</hi> and muſt awake thy gift, and thy grace, and thy tongue too: (as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> does in praiſing, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 51.8,) for that may further the fervour of the Spirit; and ſome have judged meer men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Prayer, in ſome caſes, to be a quenching of the holy Spirit of God. It's true, that ſometimes a poor Believer, when buffetted by Satan, and in an Agony through the power and violence of ſome Corruption, cannot put his troubled thoughts into words, when yet his unexpreſſible ſighs and groans may make the <hi>old man</hi> groan as a deadly wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Man. Look to this, inveterated Diſeaſes, ſtrong Corruptions, will not go out without much praying.</p>
            <p n="2">2. You can mortifie no Corruption without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing Faith, much leſs your ſtrongeſt Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; for you muſt not think firſt to mortifie Sin, and then believe; you muſt be in Chriſt, and
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:103420:52"/>be a Believer, before you can mortifie one Sin: Nature prompts men to pray in every exigence: but praying without believing, will not do, but no Corruptions can ſtand before Faith; it can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move <hi>Mountains,</hi> it can bring down <hi>ſtrong-holds:</hi> it can put to flight Armies of Aliens, of luſts; it can quench the greateſt Combuſtions in the Soul, kindled by Satans fiery Darts: hence, ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>Above all things, take unto you the ſhield of faith,</hi> Epheſ. 6.16. The Lord lends Faith his power (ſo to ſpeak) <hi>This is our victory, whereby we overcome the world, even our faith,</hi> 1 John 5.4. Now what this World is, ſee 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.16, <hi>For all that is in the world, the luſt of the fleſh, the luſt of the eye,</hi> &amp;c. Now, how does Faith aſſiſt againſt theſe?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Faith giveth a true judgment of them, and values all things aright, when others are cheated by their corrupted Senſes. 2. By Faith we ſee into Eternity, and what will be the fruit of gratifying our luſts; what will be the reward of Sin. A carnal Heart that had ſeen <hi>Dives</hi> at his ſumptuous Table, and in his gorgeous Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, and <hi>Lazarus</hi> at the Gate, and the <hi>dogs lick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his ſores,</hi> would have bleſſed the one, and ſaved himſelf from the other: But Faith at firſt ſight can ſee the one in <hi>Heaven,</hi> and the other in <hi>Hell,</hi> Pſal. 73.17, 18. 3. By Faith we ſee, that the beſt things of this World cannot further our Happineſs, nor the worſt things of the World hinder it: that worldly Honours and Pleaſures are not all a-kin to everlaſting Honour and Joy. 4. By Faith, we ſee, that the deſign of Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions is to deprive us of our Happineſs; and that Satan and the World, who work upon our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:103420:52"/>paſſions, and miniſter fewel to our luſts, have no good will to us, even when they are courting us. 5. Faith does not only aſſent to what God and Chriſt, and Heaven and Holineſs are; but it makes proof, and gets experimental diſcoveries of theſe: and this makes a man deſpiſe the painted Beauty and ſweetneſs of the Creatures, the ſight of Chriſts matchleſs Beauty and Excellency, all a mans Idols are divorced. When we ſee the Sun with our own eyes, we believe the Moon is not the moſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious light, it looks but like a clod in the Firmament: many can ſpeak contemptibly of the honours, and riches, and pleaſures of the World, who are not mortified to them, but with all their might pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue them: nor indeed will you ever be able by all the rational diſcoveries of the vanity of theſe, to mortifie inordinate love to, and delight in them, till you taſte and ſee ſomething that's better: and this taſte and ſight, Evangelical Faith can only afford. No experiences of the Worlds va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, no Contemplations of an Immortal ſtate, can do it; for Senſe will ſtill object, Where can you do better? and meer Contemplations breed only Notions: this brings in the ſubſtance of things into the Soul, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.1.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Faith does more eſpecially contribute to the mortification of our Corruptions, by its ingaging the aſſiſtance of Divine Power. It's on this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count that there is a ſort of Omnipotency attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to Faith. You do not doubt but the Lord Jeſus is able to help againſt your ſtrongeſt Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions; But how ſhall we have his help? I An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, You need not ſay, <hi>Who ſhall aſcend to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and bring him down,</hi> &amp;c? <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.6, 7. This
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:103420:53"/>thou mayſt do by Faith; But how does Faith do it? Anſw. 1. Faith does it, as it is an aſſent to the Promiſes. The Promiſes, hold forth the power of Chriſt for ſubduing of Sin, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3, compared with <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.14. Now we are intereſted in theſe Promiſes, by <hi>believing,</hi> Heb. 4.2: when we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ll be as he has ſaid; this ſome count a Phanatical point: But is it phantaſtick or pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natick to reſt upon an honeſt Mans word, much leſſer? ſure this gives more glory to God, than all our endeavours to mortifie Sin; yet takes not men off other ſubordinate means, but puts them upon the uſe of them: eſpecially upon Prayer, That it may be as he has ſaid, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.14. Man fell at firſt by taking Satans word before the Lords. And it were our wiſdom, in all Inſinuations of the like nature, to ſuſpect the hand of Satan. Now Faith does not only aſſent to the truth of the Promiſes, of ſtrength to overcome Sin; but it reſts and relies upon them; all Grace comes through the Promiſes. And indeed, the firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbency of Faith, is a great and proper act of it: and as they are bleſſed who have no aſſurance of their intereſt in the Promiſes, and yet can reſolutely rely on it; for as thoſe that ſeek the Lord are bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to <hi>rejoice,</hi> Pſal. 105.3, though they have not yet found him, becauſe of the Promiſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.19. So may thoſe encourage themſelves in the hope of ſucceſs againſt Sin, who reſt upon Gods Word, though they have not yet obtained the victory; <hi>for the Lord taketh pleaſure in them that hope in his mercy,</hi> Pſal. 147.11. The recumbency of the Soul upon his Word, ingageth both the honour of his Mercy and his Fidelity.</p>
            <pb n="99" facs="tcp:103420:53"/>
            <p n="2">2. And ſo does alſo effectually engage his Power; it's by this power through Faith, that we are kept from what would hinder our Salvation, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5. Divine Power ſtrengthens Faith; and by Faith we derive Divine Power: <hi>by faith Chriſt dwells in the heart,</hi> Epheſ. 3.17. And now we have <hi>one in us, stronger than he that is in the world, who takes his Armour from him,</hi> &amp;c. that is, taketh thoſe things from him wherewith he fortified himſelf, and ſecured Sin. Satan ſometimes ſerves himſelf of mens Wiſdom, Reaſon, Thoughts, Affections: theſe Chriſt brings into captivity to his own obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; our <hi>members</hi> which were the <hi>weapons of ſin,</hi> are made <hi>inſtruments of righteouſneſs unto ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs:</hi> Riches and Gifts, which were fewel and proviſion for luſts, are conſecrated to Chriſt. Would you then have greater advantage againſt the <hi>old man of ſin?</hi> ſit not down complaining of your impotency, and the ſtrength of Sin, and your hard circumſtances: but by Faith ſtrengthen your Union with Chriſt, and make his ſtrength yours.</p>
            <p>Finally, It is by Faith that you muſt make uſe of all your other ſpiritual <hi>Armour:</hi> that word, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.16, <hi>Above all taking the ſhield of Faith,</hi> &amp;c. ſeems not only to give Faith the preheminence, but to point out the univerſal uſefulneſs of it, for ſecuring and right uſing all the other parts of our Armour. 1. As for Truth; if you take it as relating to the Mind, for ſoundneſs of Doctrine, this is a fruit of <hi>faith,</hi> Acts 24.14. If you take it for Sincerity, it's <hi>believing</hi> (which makes God near, and ſets him before us) that advances this, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.1. So, 2. For Righteouſneſs; if you take it for the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Chriſt, which as a <hi>breaſt-plate</hi> ſecures
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:103420:54"/>the Heart and Conſcience, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.33. (If the heart be found, a wound elſewhere may be healed; if the Conſcience be whole, we may bear other infirmities). Now it's Faiths work to improve this: or, if we take it for Inherent-righteouſneſs, that is a fruit of Faith. 3. Whatever Furniture the Goſpel prepares for us, it is of no uſe without Faith. Nor, 4. Can the <hi>ſword of the Spirit</hi> be weild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without it. 5. <hi>The Helmet of ſalvation,</hi> which is <hi>Hope,</hi> (as is plain, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.8), the Grace that ſecures our head from Errour, or which keeps our head above water, <hi>that we faint not,</hi> that ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports Faith: its work is to look for the fulfilling of the Promiſe, which Faith believes. 6. Prayer muſt needs take it in: hence we ſee, why our Conflict with Sin and the World is called <hi>the fight of faith,</hi> 1 Tim. 6.12.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Be much in the meditation of the ſufferings and Death of Chriſt, and of your own approaching diſſolution, and of what follows on the back of that.</p>
            <p>For the firſt of theſe, <hi>Peter</hi> preſſes Holineſs from thence, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18, 20. But, let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider Chriſt firſt as a Pattern: he made it his work to deſtroy Sin (though he had none in himſelf), all his Offices ſtruck at Sin; and you are none of Chriſts, if you ſtudy not conformity to him in this. It's true, the <hi>Prince of this world had no part in him,</hi> yet was he moleſted with his Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: and when its ſo with thee, think with thy ſelf, What would the Lord Jeſus Chriſt have ſaid in this caſe? 2. Look on ſuffering Chriſt, as meriting and procuring his peoples final Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt over all their Enemies. We may in this
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:103420:54"/>caſe apply that, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.11, They <hi>overcame by the blood of the Lamb;</hi> his blood by Faith applyed to the Soul, is like a Refiners fire and Fullers Sope. It's the only Purgatory for taking away Sin; Satan has carryed moſt of the World from the law of Nature, into <hi>Paganiſm;</hi> and others from the Law of Chriſt, into <hi>Antichriſtianiſm:</hi> and in both theſe Apoſtate ſtates, Satan has endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſubſtitute ſomething in the room of what God had appointed for purging away Sin; and under both he ſeems more zealous againſt Sin; than God, and would ſeem to out-do Gods way: if God appoint Beaſts to be ſlain and offered up, he will have their Children to paſs through the fire; and now once <hi>offering up of Chriſt,</hi> muſt not ſerve; it muſt be done every day. So for purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of Sin: Satan had among the Heathen his Lotions and Luſtrations, and has now his Sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings and Whippings: and, to compleat all, has made men hope, that what theſe do not, <hi>Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory-fire</hi> will do. And truly, Sin may ſay, Aha to theſe: as Satan does to theſe Exorciſms. But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, Satans diligence and induſtry in taking men off the true way of purging away Sin, (<hi>viz.</hi> by the blood of Chriſt) and ſubſtituting. Mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>means in its room, may tell us what weight the Lord lays upon this way. Now, how by Faith we come to find the efficacy of this blood, I have already ſhewn.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The ſufferings of Chriſt may further Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification by way of Argument; and here we muſt take in the greatneſs of his ſufferings, the hand our ſins had in them: and the love that moved him to engage and go through with all: Oh,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:103420:55"/>would not you burn the Spear that pierced him! how would you look upon the Sword that ſlew your deareſt Friend? See how <hi>Paul</hi> argues, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14, 15, <hi>The love of Chriſt conſtrains us: for we thus judg, That if one died for all, then were all dead, that we ſhould henceforth no more live to our ſelves.</hi> And <hi>Peter</hi> on the ſame ground preſſeth Mortification, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.1, 2, <hi>For as much then as Chriſt hath ſuffered for us in the fleſh,</hi> &amp;c. Had you been witneſs to his wreſtlings in the Garden: Had you heard theſe words out of his own mouth, <hi>If it be poſſible, let this Cup paſs,</hi> &amp;c. Had you ſeen his <hi>drops of blood.</hi> Had you known the trouble of his Soul, when upon the ſight of his ſufferings, he knew not well what to ſay (to ſpeak with Reverence), <hi>John</hi> 12.27. Had you ſeen him Nailed: and heard him crying out, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> Would you not have vowed a Revenge on Sin? Could you have loved and hugged the Soldier, and been ſond on the Spear that pierced him; Thou art the Man, and thy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Luſt is the Spear. And will you act this Soldiers part over again? Your other ſins are as the Nails, but this is as the Spear that made a great wound in his Side, and went nearer his Heart: and who ſhall ſave thee, if thou <hi>crucifie him afreſh?</hi> Who ſhall comfort thee, if thou <hi>grieve his Spirit,</hi> by thy indulgence to ſin?</p>
            <p n="2">2. I mentioned the ſerious Meditation of your own death, as a Mean to help on Mortification. It were good for us we were oftner among the Tombs, and laying our ſelves in our graves: the Rich mans skul is not gilded there, nor has the delicate perſons any better colour, or ſmell;
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:103420:55"/>nor has the proud man any precedency there: their duſt and skuls, and dead bones are not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhable: yet what's the buſineſs and labour of moſt unmortified Souls, but to adorn, or pamper, or honour this corruptible, ſinful, and burthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom fleſh? we never live like Chriſtians, till we can trample upon it, and it be under our Souls feet: and till we live as if we were the next mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to die; and till we deal with ſin as we would do, when a-dying. One would think that wiſe <hi>Solomons</hi> ſad Retractations might be a warning to the Fools of following generations: How many gain little more by all their labour and care, than the Horſe does by carrying rich Commodities, a ſore back and weary legs perhaps? but a fore galled gangren'd Conſcience when you come to die, is ſoreſt of all; you who miniſter to your luſts, and never offended them: you who make proviſion for them, you are but plotting a cruel and torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing death to your ſelves, at leaſt you are making proviſion for endleſs ſorrow: you are preparing Axes and Saws, and carrying faggots and fewel to your Fire; and you that tread upon the heels of ſuch, you loſe your dying comforts, and Hell ſhall tread upon your heels, and come as near as can be: If you be ſaved, it ſhall be with more difficulty, and as it were by fire; O learn to look on Boſom-ſins in health, as you will do in ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: of all ſins, theſe will be the uglieſt, filthieſt and bittereſt; this is that which has undone me, ſays the poor Soul, I know whence all this trouble is come.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Watchfulneſs is of ſingular uſe to ſuch as would be ſucceſsful in this buſineſs of Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:103420:56"/>you muſt fight with Sin, ere you can mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie it, for Sin is not ſo tame as to made no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance. Now would you proſperouſly war with it? our life is a <hi>warfare;</hi> and in time of War, all places keeps watch and ward: You muſt firſt then watch its motions when it begins to move: Sin makes ſudden ſallies; and O how ſuddenly is a Temptation formed! it ſometimes comes like a fiery-flame, or lightning, we know not whence: yea, even temptations to that ſin which under ſome ſtrong Conviction, &amp;c. ſeems to yield, or to fly; and that corrupt affection that is ſtrongeſt, is ſooneſt ſet on fire: there's need of moſt care that no fire come near the place where Powder or Flax lies. 2. There's need of Watching, in order to the improving the advantages we at any time have againſt our Corruptions, whether by afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or by ſome providential Rebuke, reſpecting that ſin; or by ſome ſtrong Conviction upon the Mind, or by ſome ſpecial recruit of freſh inward ſtrength and livelineſs of Soul; or by ſome ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ſucceſs againſt ſin, and ſins of <hi>falling as light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from heaven,</hi> &amp;c. The watchful Chriſtian diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns and makes good uſe of theſe: any ſeen ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage does encourage the Soul to keep up the Warfare, and alſo hearten it to purſue it's advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. 3. It keeps a man under continual ſenſe of weakneſs and impotency, and need of borrowed ſtrength; the more a man makes conſcience of conflicting and warring with ſin, he cannot but the more experience theſe. Now, much of our ſtrength lies in an humble ſenſe of weakneſs: hence ſays <hi>Paul, When I am weak, then am I ſtrong:</hi> this puts the Soul on praying and believing; when
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:103420:56"/>any Grace grows faint, and Sin gets ground, the watchful man obſerves this, and calls in Prayer and Faith to his aſſiſtance; he engages him in whom is everlaſting ſtrength; he lays over the buſineſs on him, and then the Battel becomes the Lords: as, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.5, 6, &amp;c. with <hi>ver.</hi> 15. The watchful Chriſtian obſerves when, and where he is weak, and what diſadvantages he is at, and what is the craft and policy, and power of his Adverſaries, and he makes an Errand to God; yea, and an argument of each of theſe in Prayer: and indeed, the watchful Chriſtian ſees himſelf never out of danger, and ſo never wants matter of Prayer; as he dare not caſt off Prayer, ſo wants he not work after Prayer: hence <hi>Watching,</hi> and <hi>Praying</hi> are ſo often coupled together: Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs diſcovers the danger, and Believing Prayer prevents it; it lays the matter at Chriſts door. The reaſon why ſome are ſo ſeldom victorious o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Temptations, is, becauſe they are ſeldom on their knees, or their hands are a ſhort while up: and the reaſon why they are ſeldom at the Throne of Grace, and have little to ſay, or ſoon tir'd, is, becauſe they are ſeldom on their Watch-Tower.</p>
            <p>Under this Direction, I may take in the cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off the occaſions of that ſin eſpecially, that oftneſt prevails with you: this cuts off inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe between Satan and the Soul. Whthhold fewel from thy luſts: without this, you do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, all your labour is in vain. If there be fewel in thy hand, or thy houſe, and there be dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly occaſion to ſin miniſtred, ſo much as to the eye, thou cannot be ſafe; ſeek by all means to ſtarve
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:103420:57"/>thy Idols: as in War, when an Army can do no more, they demoliſh the Enemies places of ſtrength, and endeavour to obſtruct their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruits, and to ſtop their proviſions: do thou in like manner with ſin; whatever thou haſt uſed as an occaſion to the fleſh, fee that in that thou af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict thy ſelf: and cut off that occaſion, as <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> did with her Hair, <hi>Luke</hi> 7.39. Run away from a Temptation, and go not to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt borders of thy liberty: and venture not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what ſome others may lawfully do, being in other circumſtances: ſtudy moderation in things lawful, <hi>uſe not thy liberty as an occaſion to ſin,</hi> &amp;c. Suſpect things that are pleaſant to thee: there is danger, where thou finds delight. <hi>Solomon</hi> is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in preſſing the avoiding of <hi>ſnares.</hi> Prov. 5.8. and 23.31. That Prohibition, <hi>Deut.</hi> 25.13, is memorable to this purpoſe, <hi>Thou ſhalt not have in thy Bag divert weights, a great and a ſmall.</hi> So <hi>Deut.</hi> 12.13, <hi>You ſhall not enquire how the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſerve their gods.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now in purſuance of this, 1. You muſt keep a ſtrict guard upon your ſenſes, and double your guard when there is need: it is by the ſenſes that inordinate affections are kindled: the Wanton is infected and enticed, by gazing upon anothers Beauty; the Drunkard and the Glutton, by ſeeing or taſting the Cup, or ſome pleaſant food; Silly effeminate Souls are tempted by the ſight of gawdy faſhions: the ſight of Pomp and Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence kindleth Ambition; the Covetous cannot ſee Money, nor fine Buildings, nor rich Furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, nor a pleaſant Field, but his heart akes with <hi>Ahabs</hi> diſeaſe; Take an account of all that
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:103420:57"/>comes in by your ſenſes, for you muſt give an account: ſuffer not any of your ſenſes to ſtir without leave: or if they do, let them not fix and ſettle without leave. If the Door ſhall ſtand alway open, the Houſe will certainly be robbed; therefore pray and practice that, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 119.37. 2. Look alſo narrowly to your thoughts, theſe are the Shop in which ſin is forged: Do you not feel what advantage Satan hath againſt you in theſe? If you feel your thoughts ſtepping out, then call them in, and examine them, as <hi>Eliſha</hi> did to <hi>Gehazi;</hi> be ſure your hearts will be ſuch as your thoughts; you cannot have a ſerious heart, <hi>if vain thoughts lodg within you,</hi> Jer. 4.14. 3. Fly the ſociety of ſuch as are ſick of that diſeaſe thou dreads moſt, and which thou art apteſt to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with: It is not good fighting againſt the Devil (ſays one) in the midſt of his own Camp: Mens bold venturing on this, has often brought them off wounded. It's hard to keep up a due abhorrence of ſin, that we daily ſee and hear; ſome ill ſavour at leaſt will ſtick to us, if it bring you not to a compliance, yet it abates your zeal againſt it; therefore ſhun ſuch Employments, Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions and Company, as may draw forth thy Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. It was <hi>Peters</hi> ſnare to be in the <hi>High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieſts Hall;</hi> and <hi>Judas</hi>'s, that he carried the <hi>Bug.</hi> It's hard for Powder and Flax to be near Fire, and not kindle.</p>
            <p>The 5th Direction: Improve Afflictions for the mortification of thy ſin: by theſe the Lord takes away ſin, and makes us partakers of his holineſs; the finer any Veſſel be, and the more uſed, the oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner it's ſcoured, and the more it be rubbed, the
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:103420:58"/>cleaner it is, <hi>Lev.</hi> 6.28, and 11.33, The <hi>earthen pots</hi> when they were fouled by boiling of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, they were to be broken in pieces; but the <hi>brazen pots</hi> were to be reinſed with Water, and ſcoured and cleaned: the oftner you are on the fire, the cleaner ſhould you be. Now when God is wounding your Pride, your Covetouſneſs, your Senſuality, take the advantage of ſlaying theſe luſts: when he makes thy right-hand, or Eye to ake, then <hi>pluck it out,</hi> &amp;c. Canſt thou love the World when it pinches, and ſtraitens, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſames, and reproaches thee? Canſt thou love thy fleſh, when pain and grief have taken up their dwelling in it, and when it's ſuch a trouble to thee? Will you not now cry out upon all <hi>as vanity and vexation,</hi> when your ſenſe and your Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence tells you ſo, when you feel the bitter fruits of ſin? you have now great advantage againſt your ſin, and to help on the mortification of it, when ſenſe and Experience diſparage and decry it, and your very fleſh is convinced of the folly of fleſh-pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; O that you would take this advantage, and uſe this World, as it does or will uſe you; and uſe your ſins as they do, or will uſe you. There be indeed ſome unmortified men, who when they ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer by ſin and by the World, will ſpeak hardly enough of them: but their friendſhip (which is rooted in their Nature) is ſoon made up again: But ſhould it not heighten your Enmity with them? the Lord makes your ſin buffet, and abuſe, and rend, and wound you; that by the pain, and ſmart, and ſorrow it breeds, he may maintain and encreaſe your enmity, and excite diligent endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to deſtroy it: he had rather that ſin ſhould
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:103420:58"/>pain you here, than torment you in Hell; and he would have ſins ſtroke to fall upon it ſelf: as ſin killed it ſelf in killing Chriſt, ſo he would have it in his people: Let your afflictions, let the death of your Creature-comforts, be the death of ſin. If it turn your very breath into groans, let theſe groans be againſt ſin: if it turn your Joy into mourning, your Songs into ſighs, and cries, and tears, let all theſe be againſt ſin; and ſo your Life, and your Light, and your Comfort ſhall riſe out of the ruins of your ſin. O let ſin gain nothing by the hurt it does you; If it has brought a croſs upon thy Perſon, or Family, take it, and crucifie it upon this Croſs, elſe thou loſeſt the benefit of it: if thus thou dealeſt with it, it's a happy Croſs, and thou haſt fellowſhip with Chriſt in his Croſs, on which ſin ſuffered. Many have been convinced of the ill of Sin, that have fought but faintly with it, till it has wounded them.</p>
            <p>And now, let me a little enquire if this has been the fruit of your perſonal or Family-afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or of the ſore aſtoniſhing Judgments of God upon this place: You have ſeen many Houſes and Streets burnt down in fewer days than they were hundreds of yeares in building. You have ſeen Riches that were many years in ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering, ſcattered, or may be in a few hours conſumed: and the Lord knows how many have loſt their Souls, and forfeited eternal happineſs to build, and furniſh, and gather that which a few moments pulled down, ſcattered and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed: and yet when you have but a little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termiſſion and breathing-time, are you not as
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:103420:59"/>eagerly at it again? You have ſeen or heard of what deſolations God did make, and what a Cry was almoſt in every Houſe: not the cry of <hi>Egypt,</hi> not the <hi>firſt-born</hi> only; but as a man emptieth a Diſh, and turneth it upſide down, ſo did God with many Families, and many Houſes: Have the diſmal Looks and Out-cries of theſe days morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied you to carnal Mirth? Have you learned Righteouſneſs? Have you made your dwellings <hi>Bethels?</hi> You have ſeen or heard of but a few years ago, many as delicate Perſons as your ſelves, whoſe Carcaſſes were carried out in Dung-carts, and thrown into pits, heaps upon heaps? and will you yet pleaſe and pamper ſuch Carcaſſes? Will you gather and patch up (as it were) their rags to adorn your Bodies with? Ah! the aſhes of <hi>London,</hi> and the duſt of thoſe dead Bodies, ſhall be witneſſes againſt the preſent Inhabitants: Does your Houſes, your Tables, your Apparel ſpeak any growth of Mortification? the higheſt Turret or Pyramid, is but a poor childiſh Memorial. Is there a <hi>Memento</hi> written upon each of theſe? But alas, what then means your ceiled and well-fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed Houſes, while the <hi>Houſe of God lies waſte?</hi> What means your ſtrange Apparel, and ſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Tables, while, may be, there be few Backs or Bellies of Chriſts Diſciples that are bleſſing you?</p>
            <p>Have you not fallen into Old <hi>London</hi>'s ſins, ſooner than men took up the Old Worlds ſins? <hi>Noah</hi> did indeed for once border upon the ſin that God had buried in the Waters: And are not many Profeſſors more guilty in reviving ſins that God has burnt up (to ſpeak ſo)? Ah! Will you
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:103420:59"/>break through, not only Armies of Ordinances, but Armies of Judgments? Will you in your pride of heart, and in your practice, alſo ſay, the <hi>Bricks are fallen, and we will build with hewen ſtone;</hi> the <hi>Sycamores</hi> are cut down, but we will exchange them into <hi>Cedars?</hi> Will you ſay, we will have better Houſes, and finer Cloaths? If you have forgotten what your Eyes have ſeen, and your Ears have heard, come and behold yet the works of the Lord, and ſee what deſolation he is now making amongſt others! Not only <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> but other places, that were like the Vinetrees amongſt the Trees of the Foreſt, God has given them to the fire for fewel, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 12.20. He hath made <hi>Lebanon</hi> to open its doors to the fire, to devour the Cedars that are fallen; and the Fir-tree howls alſo: yea, the <hi>Oaks of Baſhan</hi> howl, <hi>Zoch.</hi> 11.1, 2. He makes theſe ſmart, that others may fear: But Oh, ſhall ſuch things as happen for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, and are worthy to be recorded for Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition to the end of the World, have no ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect upon th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſe to whom they happen? Shall the ſame generation repeat, yea, out-do their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſins? Can you with grief remember your Loſſes, and with no regret remember your Pride and Covetouſneſs? Will you fruſtrate Reproach, and defame Gods Methods of Judgment, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim to the World, that his deſign has miſcarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon you, and that you will not be healed? Shall the Rod in <hi>Moſes</hi>'s hand cleave the Rock, and ſhall it in Gods hand cleave no hearts? Muſt the Lords Miniſters with grief of heart, go and complain againſt you to him, and ſay, Lord, Thou haſt ſtricken them, but they have not grieved;
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:103420:60"/>thou haſt conſumed them, but they have refuſed to receive Correction; they have made their faces harder than a Rock: This is a Nation, and this is a City that obeyeth not the voice of the Lord, nor receiveth Correction. And O that we could ſigh for this, even to the breaking of our Loins. Now, how can you weep with them that weep, that have forgotten your own afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or rather never could weep aright for your ſelves? Or, if there be any Mourners among you, yet ſure I am, you are far from Sackcloth and Aſhes. But do you think that God has done with you? there's a dreadful word, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 15.6, 7, <hi>I will ſet my face againſt them; and they ſhall go out from one fire, and another ſhall devour them:</hi> Hath he not ſtrange puniſhments for the Workers of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity? If <hi>London</hi>'s ſins be greater now than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Peſtilence, or before the Fire, what Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, if greater Judgments from God come? If God ſhall give you up into the hands of bloody <hi>Papiſts,</hi> it will be worſe than Fire or Peſtilence, in <hi>Davids</hi> reckoning, as we ſee by his choice; and yet better have fallen into the hands of the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtins,</hi> or <hi>Ammonites,</hi> or any Enemies <hi>David</hi> had, than into the hands of Antichriſtian Butchers: And for any thing we know, we are not half a hand-breadth from it. I pretend not to any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Diſcovery of Gods Counſels: but as we may Prophecy from ſin to puniſhment, ſo from greater and ſtranger ſins, to greater and ſtranger puniſhments.</p>
            <p>I might mention other Directions, as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging all thy might againſt that ſin that prevails moſt over thee, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 8.30: and the endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:103420:60"/>to grow particularly in the oppoſite grace. Finally, the Conſideration of Chriſts <hi>ſecond Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> Col. 3.4, with <hi>ver.</hi> 5. 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.2, with <hi>ver.</hi> 3. Will you wallow in ſin when Chriſt is ſo near? Muſt thou be made like to him, and wilt now let thy Soul ſwarm with noiſom luſts? Can thou look for him, and not mortifie what cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied him. But I proceed to ſpeak in the third place to the mortification of the firſt motions of Sin.</p>
            <p>Now here I ſhall, 1. ſhew the ſinfulneſs of theſe. 2. I ſhall ſhew whence it is, that they abound ſo much with ſome. 3. I ſhall preſs the mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of them from ſeveral Conſiderations. 4. I ſhall mention ſome helps to this.</p>
            <p>For the firſt, That every motion ariſing from the Corruption of the Heart, or from habitual Luſt, whether it has a particular Object, or be but a vagrant Imagination, though not delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in, nor conſented to, is ſin before God, will eaſily appear; if we conſider, 1. That they ariſe from a ſinful Principle: they are <hi>born of the fleſh,</hi> and are of the nature of Original ſin; and if the <hi>Tree be corrupt,</hi> ſo muſt every bit of the <hi>fruit.</hi> 2. They are diſconform to the Law of God (and ſo muſt be ſinful in their Nature, as well as in their Riſe) they <hi>luſt againſt,</hi> and <hi>oppoſe the Spirit,</hi> Gal. 5.17. and ſo muſt oppoſe the Law of God; If they be againſt the Law in the heart, they are alſo againſt the written Law: Though you ſhould cruſh them, yet once they were; if they had no inordinacy in them, why were they cruſhed? If there be any diſorder or inordinacy in them, it is from us they have theſe; and ſo they muſt
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:103420:61"/>leave a guilt upon us. 3. Their ſinful tendency and effects prove this. To inſtance but a few: 1. They are incitements to ſin, and promote obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the law of ſin, and the fulfilling of its commands. 2. They make way for other ſins, beſide what they do immediately and directly tend to: they open the door, and keep it open, for temptations to groſs ſins, and gives Satan acceſs to blow up the Cole. 3. They keep out good Motions, and ſo muſt obſtruct Duties, and unfit a man for them. 4. As they are contrary to right Reaſon, and not anſwerable to that Angelical Holineſs and Purity that ſhould be in us: ſo they cannot but leave ſome blot and defilement behind them: let theſe Motions be never ſo paſſing and tranſient, and run never ſo ſwiftly through us, they muſt needs taint us, by reaſon of our corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that in leſs or more ſtill ſideth with them: they have alway the virtual conſent of the will, in as far as not regenerated, and ſo cannot ſimply be ſaid to be involuntary (which is the great Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection made againſt this Truth), though they be againſt the renewed Will, which <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. O how many vile ſins are ſtirring in the heart, that are not deliberate nor expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citely conſented to, yet are voluntary, becauſe they have their ſeat and riſe in the Will, as well as other faculties. 5. They hinder our Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God; do you think, that if he had his due, there would be any room left for theſe? Have they any place in Heaven, where the Saints enjoy full Communion with God? and if they be inconſiſtent with that, they muſt be a hinderance to this.</p>
            <pb n="115" facs="tcp:103420:61"/>
            <p>Now it is upon theſe accounts, that the fainteſt Motions and ſtirrings of ſin, are grievous to the godly, eſpecially when it is beſt with them. The tender lively Chriſtian, as he <hi>groans under a body of ſin,</hi> ſo it never ſtirs but he feels it, and is pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with it: the moſt ſudden vagrant motions of the Mind, Heart and Affections, are burthenſom to him: and that not only as they bewray a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving principle of ſin in his Soul, but as they are ſinful gaddings, and in ſome meaſure whoriſh de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partings of the heart from God, and inconſiſtent with that intire and uninterrupted delight the Soul ſhould have in him; and that continual af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate working, and out-going that ſhould be in the Soul toward him. It may be indeed, he delights in the Law of God after the <hi>inward-man,</hi> yet he cannot reach full conformity to it within, more than in his practice outwardly: when he reſolveth on ſome good, ere he be aware, his heart is wandring a hundred ways, and ſo ill is preſent with him.</p>
            <p>O be convinced of the ſinfulneſs of this: how often is your Mind ſtirring and roving? (for it's a reſtleſs thing) and how rarely can you ſay that theſe motions are conformable to the Law of God, or ſubſervient to any ſpiritual good. What Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of vain Imaginations that are unaccount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able? you know not how they come in, nor how they go out; infinite are the occaſions that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite theſe; You can ſee nor hear of nothing, but habitual Corruption may ſome way ſtir: yea, you think of nothing, whether exiſtent or not, but it excites ſome inordinate Motions: hence they are called <hi>the Imaginations of the heart,</hi> Gen. 6.8, <hi>The
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:103420:62"/>wandring of the deſire,</hi> Eccleſ. 6.9. It's true, this is a further degree of ſinful ſtirrings in the heart, when it entertains wild Imaginations, and pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it ſelf with idle Fancies, that give riſe to many ſinful projects. Indeed, Nature it ſelf teacheth this to be a ſin, and it's an evidence of a diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented frame of ſpirit; for ordinarily theſe phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtick rovings of heart, reſpects ſome other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons Condition, or ſomething at leaſt that we want: the delight that accompanies theſe, is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to prove them ſinful; but it's plainly ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſs than theſe that <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7: for it's ſomething he had not <hi>known to be ſin, but by the Law.</hi> Now men by Natures light know that inordinate motions conſented to (though not acted); yea, or but delighted in, are ſinful. But it's the Scriptures-light only that convinces of the ſin of theſe firſt ſtirrings in general: and it's the Spirit's Saving-light, that affects the heart with godly ſorrow for them in particular.</p>
            <p>For the ſecond thing propoſed, <hi>viz.</hi> Why they abound ſo much with ſome, more eſpecially that they are exceeding frequent with all, I think none that know themſelves will deny; and what ſwarms of them do mens buſie-Minds and Imaginations bring forth? How hard is it to bring every thought inconſiſtent with that Duty and love we owe to God, and that we owe to Men, into ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection? It's hard to expel them when they come in, and much harder not to ſuffer them to come in; ſuch is the cunning and activity of ſin, ſuch acceſs has Satan to work upon us, and ſo Leavened are our Imaginations and Minds with ſin.</p>
            <p>Yet in ſome they are more frequent than others:
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:103420:62"/>the beſt groan under them, but ſome are almoſt ſmothered with them (to ſpeak ſo) and their grace almoſt ſuffocated with them. Habitual Corruption is a fruitful Womb, and this is livelier in ſome than in others: and the ſame perſon is nearer God, and in a livelier frame, and has more inward ſerenity, and compoſure of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit at one time than another: and ſo is like a City with Gates and Bars. At other times a man is at greater diſtance from God and out of frame; and then he is like a City broken down, and without Walls, and the heart is haunted with Satyrs and Owls. When the heart is in an ill frame, it is like damp Tinder to divine Motions: but it's like dry Tinder to every ſpark of a temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation that comes in by the ſenſes, or by roving Imagination; yea, it takes fire of its ſelf: and if it be not well watched, would quickly come to a flame. Indeed, it's no eaſie task to keep out theſe, there is ſo many ſeveral paſſages they come in at, and they can creep in at a ſmall rent or hole: therefore there's need of the utmoſt watchfulneſs and diligence to keep them out, and to knock them down when they come in.</p>
            <p>For the third thing propoſed, <hi>viz.</hi> Some Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations for preſſing the mortification of theſe firſt ſtirrings of our Corruptions: 1. I ſhall mention ſome Aggravations of the ſin and ſad conſequences of theſe. 2. I ſhall mention ſome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages the Believer has by mortifying theſe. For the firſt of theſe, Conſider, 1. How frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by theſe you incur the guilt of ſin: O the numberleſs multitude of theſe inordinate moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons! When are you free of them? When is the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:103420:63"/>
               <hi>body of death</hi> aſleep? not when you are aſleep, for waking and ſleeping, theſe inordinate motions are ſome way ſtirring: and it were eaſie to prove, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very inordinate, extravagant, luſtful, covetous, ambitious motion, even when aſleep, and dreaming, to be ſinful and defiling: and indeed, what proves the firſt motions of ſin, when awake to be ſinful, does alſo prove them ſuch when aſleep; and the more power a Chriſtian when awake, has over them; the more holy he be, the leſs is he troubled with theſe: and it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt that they are the flowings out, the bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, and ſpringings up, or emanations of our O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal Corruption, or the imperfect motions of vitious principles or habits: for as Innocent dreams follow the ſinleſs conſtitution of the body, ſo ſinful dreams follow the vitious conſtitution of the Soul, which poſſibly a mans natural temper of body hath advantaged; and ſo are groſs out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward acts of ſin alſo, which yet does not prove them to be no ſins. We cannot think that our Nature in the ſtate of Innocency would have brought forth any ſuch inordinate motions, ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or waking: ſo that the Apology ſome make for them, as being Natural, is naught; they are in no other ſenſe Natural, nay, nor neceſſary, than the ſame motions when one is awake: If any ſhall ſay, they are from Satans injections which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der us not culpable:</p>
            <p>I Anſwer 1. This is the ſame with what the <hi>Quakers</hi> ſay of the firſt riſings of Corruption, when one is awake: the contrary of which our Lord tells us, <hi>Luke</hi> 6.45. And <hi>James</hi> tells us, <hi>they are from a mans luſt,</hi> James 1.14. And truly, I
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:103420:63"/>think we do often ſinfully transfer our guilt over to Satan, when there's not ſufficient ground for it, no not ſo much as <hi>Eve</hi> had, though her plea was not relievant. Ordinarily we attribute horrid, blaſphemous, or other abominable thoughts or Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations to him, when we cannot apprehend how ſuch or ſuch a thought ſhould ariſe in us: ſo, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we think unaccountable, we lay at his door, when indeed the height and depth of our Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption is unmeaſurable, and its ſubtilty, and activity, and way of operating, is unaccount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. 2. It is not Satan that thinketh or wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in us: he may repreſent Objects, but the acts are ours: he can dart in a Temptation, but it's through our ſin and Corruption that it takes fire in the leaſt: indeed ſuch is now our Conſtitution, that a temptation cannot enter, but there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing within that complies with it, and is excited by it: and this is one great reaſon why we ought to pray, not <hi>to be led into temptation;</hi> were there no Corruption in us, Satans temptations would be like little ſparks of fire thrown into a Sea of water; and indeed, Satan would not be ſo buſie with his Injections into our Minds, when ſleeping or waking, did he not intend thereby to defile us with them, and involve us into ſin: his deſign cannot be meerly to afflict men with them, for they are no grief nor affliction to many that are yet filled with them. It's true, the Saints grieve more, and are more affected with them, and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for them, than for many afflictions that in themſelves are more troubleſome; but this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward trouble of Conſcience for them in the godly, does rather prove them ſins, than meer afflictions.</p>
            <pb n="120" facs="tcp:103420:64"/>
            <p>If any ſay, That theſe Motions when aſleep, are not acts of our Reaſon, but of meer phancy and Imagination, and ſo not ſinful. I anſwer, 1. The holy Law of God reaches to the whole man, even the Imagination: and we cannot ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe but that imperfect holineſs, and perſect holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in Heaven, extends to every faculty of the Soul. 2. They are not meer acts of the phancy, for the Mind has ſome uſe of Reaſon, though more imperfect, even when aſleep: Hence there is ſome correſpondence ordinarily between mens thoughts waking and ſleeping; and ſometimes one aſleep, will reject a temptation upon rational and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid grounds: I do not indeed think there's ſo much guilt in theſe Motions aſleep, as when awake, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of a more perfect uſe of Reaſon in a waking man.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Conſider the innumerable Objects of theſe ſinful Motions, and ſo into how many ſeveral ſpecies or forts of ſin theſe Motions engage and involve you in. You cannot ſee nor hear of any thing: you cannot think of any thing, whether it have a being or not, but it may miniſter occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to ſome inordinate motion. Innumerable are the occaſions of theſe; what ſtirrings of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, and wiſhes, and ſometimes how pleaſed with idle Imaginations.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Conſider what pretences men have to evade Convictions of the ſinfulneſs of theſe Motions, when not conſented to, nor may be delighted in, eſpecially when the object of theſe is ſome lawful thing, much more when its ſome ſpiritual good; the Spirit that is in us, doth often luſt ſecretly to envy others: when, may be, diſcontented or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:103420:64"/>thoughts are not perfectly formed: theſe are but little obſerved in us. 4. Conſider, that not mortifying of theſe, is the way not only to further ſin, but it does inſenſibly bring on hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heart; when the heart is habitually haunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with theſe, it's hard to expel theſe ſwarms that have had quiet poſſeſſion: they do exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly wear out tenderneſs, and the ſenſe of the ſinfulneſs of Sin in every degree of it. 5. They do unframe the Soul, and unfit it for ſpiritual Duties: Thus, <hi>when we would do good, evil is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with us;</hi> they juſtle out holy Meditations, at leaſt they weaken and divert the Soul in it, and cauſe many interruptions in it: they mar fixed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heart in Duties, and they not only polute them, but eat out the life of them: they are like ravenous Birds upon our Sacrifices, that are not to be ſuffered to light upon them. Finally, What a woful tendency have they, and what an inlet to temptations, and to further degrees of Sin? they even invite Satan to tempt, Satan and Sin never ſay they have enough: every conception of Sin is in order to a Birth: and every ſtirring of Sin, is for the carrying on its war againſt God and thy Soul, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.11. But of this already.</p>
            <p>Now 2dly, A little of the advantages of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying the firſt motions of Sin. 1. This is the way to prevent much Sin; and were we making conſcience of this, we ſhould find Mortification a much more eaſie work: An Oak, when a plant, is eaſily pulled up; a little ſpark is ſoon quenched: you complain of the ſtrength of your Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but you are firſt to blame that you have ſuffered the habits of Sin to grow ſo ſtrong, and
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:103420:65"/>then that you cruſh not the firſt actual Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of theſe corrupt habits; If you ſuffer them to proceed but a little, they may be indeed too hard for you. O fooliſh Souls, who put off this; Is it hard to mortifie the firſt motions of thy heart to Sin? and does thou think it will be eaſie to mortifie Sin at once, when it's increaſed into thouſands, and fortified with ſtrong holds? If thou cannot tell the firſt thoughts of it, how wilt thou do when it has got thy hearty conſent, thy love and delight, and long poſſeſſion? 2. This is the way to keep the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience pure and clear: a renewed Conſcience will charge guilt upon thee, upon the account of theſe; and no reaſoning or extenuations will ſatisfie it, till thou be truly humbled before the Lord for theſe; and vigorouſly alſo ſetting thy ſelf to ſuppreſs them. A tender Conſcience has a deep Impreſſion of the ſinfulneſs of theſe, as <hi>Paul</hi> had, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.24: and thou cannot maintain thy peace, nor aſſurance of thy freedom from Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor keep up thy glorying in God, but by dealing with them as he did. Oh, how ſmall a matter (if I may ſo ſpeak) will break a tender Chriſtians peace! leſs than a wrong look or word will do it; he cannot let half a thought away without a challenge; he has but one eye upon his priviledges and comforts, and a little Cloud will darken that. What makes a man go without much light or comfort, in whom yet you can ſee no ſpot nor flaw, and who alſo are not under the power of any particular, inward, or heart-ſin; the Spirits Comforting-work, and Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſing-work is eaſily marred. Oh, but the man
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:103420:65"/>that is daily keeping or beating down the firſt riſings of Sin, may glory as <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 7.25, &amp; 8.1; He thus preſerves a ſweet ſerenity, and calm within: he ſuffers no Clouds to gather, he diſſipates the malignant Vapours that ariſe from within, and ſuffers them not to unite; He cruſhes Satans deſign againſt him in the very Egg.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This will keep the Soul in caſe for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing and walking with God; in caſe for ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him, and for every ſpiritual Duty: every inordinate Thought or Imagination is a looking away from God, and imports a heedleſneſs and a liſtleſneſs to him. Walking with God requires an holy, even, uniform frame of Spirit: And O how much would this raiſe and ſpiritualize Prayer, Meditation and other Duties? then are our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices holy and untainted, when neither Birds nor Flies are ſuffered to light, at leaſt not to ſit upon them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. This were the way to weaken and deſtroy the very <hi>body of ſin:</hi> When a Tree is cut down, the living Root ſends up a great many ſprouts and ſmall twigs: But if you will pave the place where the Tree ſtood, or make a High-way over it, the very Root will die, which otherwiſe would have preſerved it ſelf; So after Sin is ſore ſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, yet the Root abiding through the ſeat of waters, that is, Satans Influences, it may ſpring: But when theſe firſt ſhootings up are nipt, when the Root of Sin cannot put forth it ſelf, it dies: this does as it were ſtop the breath of Sin: this makes the <hi>old man</hi> pant and die, even as Grace lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes, when the actings of it are obſtructed.</p>
            <pb n="124" facs="tcp:103420:66"/>
            <p>Now in the fourth place, take a few Directions: 1. For preventing theſe ſtirrings of ſin within, and 2. For compreſſing and laying them, when they are up.</p>
            <p>For the firſt of theſe, take theſe Directions: 1. In general, what is formerly ſaid of <hi>Watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> is of uſe here, more eſpecially; ſometimes Temptations ſeize upon our Judgments, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times upon our Affections unawares: and when they have tainted the Affections, they have eaſie acceſs to the Mind, and need to be carefully watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Look to the firſt ſprings of Sin: when we are <hi>aſleep, the Enemy is ſowing tares,</hi> and they quickly grow up; Temptations do often ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſault, and the thoughts and motions of the Heart are nimble, they are ſwift and inſtantane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: a ſpark of fire does no ſooner kindle Powder, than a Temptation does excite ſome inordinate mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Heart; If all the doors and windows of the Soul be not kept cloſe, there will be <hi>fiery dants</hi> flung in, and ſome ſparks of temptations will take fire, and thou can never ſhut doors and windows ſo cloſe, but when thou haſt done all, thou haſt need to watch: Satan can eſpy a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage into thy heart that thou didſt not think of; he has a party, and thou haſt an Enemy within thee, that will let him in. If thou be aſleep, it may be indeed thy ſeverity to indwelling ſin will irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate it, and provoke it to mutiny, and ſo occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion greater confuſion in thy Soul: but dread not this, nor ever look for good from thy indulgence and tenderneſs to thy corrupt luſts or affections, their war is better than their peace: ſuſpect that inward quiet that comes from any favour to ſin, or connivance at it.</p>
            <pb n="125" facs="tcp:103420:66"/>
            <p>The Apoſtle tells us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.8, <hi>That ſin took oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion by the Commandment,</hi> &amp;c. One great hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Mortification, is, that ſin is thought not ſo noiſom as it is; but when the <hi>Commandment</hi> comes: when the Word beats down that conceit, by exacting thorough Obedience, upon the higheſt peril, and laying bonds on the very thoughts, this inrages Corruption, and it grows more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly: It is not the proper effect of the Law to ſtir up ſin, more than the impetuous' running of water is the proper effect of a Bank of Earth, which was made to dam it up; nor is it the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per effect of diligent endeavours for mortifying all inward motions, to excite them and make them more tumultuous. Sometimes ſtrict watching of ſin makes it more cunning: ſometimes it provokes an eruption of it, and then the poor Believer is apt to think his caſe worſe than before. But was it worſe with <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 7, than formerly? In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, it's hard to keep Corruption in cloſe Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and to marr all communication between Satan and it, to ſuffer none to go out or come in: But Watchfuln ſs will do much, thoughts will be ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and affections will be ſtirring; therefore it were our wiſdom, to ask them whence they come, and whither they go? if from Satan, or from the fleſh? if from Heaven, or from the Spirit? and arreſt what have an evil aſpect, or tendency or favour, and do Juſtice upon them: what are dubious, keep them Priſoners, till thou has further examined them; for Satans meſſengers oft-times come diſguiſed, and with Chriſts Word in their mouths; and the motions of ſin are often miſtaken for ſpiritual motions: as the Porters
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:103420:67"/>ſtood continually at the door of the Temple; to keep out the unclean of all ſorts, ſo muſt you do with all that defile, or is like to defile, if you be holy Temples to God to <hi>dwell in.</hi> Yet for all that I have ſaid of them, a Believer muſt not be too much in examining of them, ſo as to be taken off more profitable work; nor indeed can we ever keep account of them, they are ſo innumer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able: ſhould we ever be purſuing and tracing them, there ſhould be room for no Duty elſe. And finally, becauſe as they come ſuddenly, ſo often they fly as ſwiftly away.</p>
            <p>Now under this Head, I would commend un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you a careful ſearch into, and intimate ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with thy own heart, that thou may know where thou art weakeſt, and what advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages Satan has againſt thee: What ſin does moſt intirely beſet thee: which is the ſoft place of thy Soul, which Satans darts do with moſt eaſe enter into? What corrupt paſſions and affections are moſt eaſily kindled in thee. And where thou ſees the greateſt danger, keep the ſtrongeſt watch: and do not only keep at diſtance from ſuch oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions and temptations, as may moſt likely draw out thy Corruptions; but keep thy very thoughts at the greateſt diſtance from theſe: ſuffer not thy ſelf to think of them, except it be to reproach them, or to provoke greater abhorrence of them: and this alſo muſt be prudentially ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Endeavour to keep your hearts under a deep ſenſe of the ſinfulneſs of Sin, even of theſe firſt motions: a Natural man is not troubled for the ſin of theſe, or for the diſconformity of them
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:103420:67"/>to any Law (though he may for outward actings of ſin) becauſe Natures light does not diſcover the ſinfulneſs of them: though it may be, he may be angry at them as they moleſt him, or tend to ſomething that he abhors: and here lies one diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the truly godly, and others; yet we muſt grant that oft-times the godly think but too meanly of theſe, and do not apprehend ſo much ill in them as there is: and hence guard not ſufficiently againſt them, nor yet do ſufficiently bewail them; may be, you are eaſily ſatisfied with your Repentance for theſe, and think gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral confeſſions and complaints ſufficient: Do you uſe to make an Errand to God, to confeſs theſe, and to beg a particular pardon for them. <hi>Peter</hi> makes a <hi>Peradventure</hi> of the forgiveneſs of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Magus</hi>'s <hi>thought,</hi> Acts 8.22. True, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>s a more deliberate approved thought, but an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed Soul will many times make a <hi>peradventure</hi> to it ſelf, of the forgiveneſs of a more imperfect and rejected Thought.</p>
            <p>I would not grieve ſuch: but for others let me ask you, Do you not know that <hi>God is a Jealous God?</hi> Jealouſie amongſt men, importeth an apt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to ſuſpect an Jnjury; a Husband, <hi>viz.</hi> is jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous when he is apt to ſuſpect his Wifes want of love, or loyalty to him upon ſmall circumſtances, without evident ground ſo to do; and withall, it imports indignation againſt the ſmalleſt ground of ſuſpition: this it cannot endure, <hi>viz.</hi> Any thing that looks like the inclination of the heart to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother: ſays <hi>Joſhua, You cannot ſerve the Lord; for he is a holy God, Chap.</hi> 24. <hi>ver.</hi> 19. It's true, He hath manifeſted this eſpecially in the matters of
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:103420:68"/>his Worſhip and Inſtitutions, according to his threatning annexed to the ſecond Commandment, as in the inſtance of <hi>Aaron</hi>'s two Sons, and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zza,</hi> and the <hi>Bethſhemites,</hi> &amp;c. But may we not think that God is as jealous of the heart as of any thing, and that he will take notice of every motion of it, and will reſent every diſloyal glance of the thoughts, though it come not the length of a purpoſe: nay, nor any deliberation in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to a purpoſe or reſolution? Is there not more ſin in many ſudden-paſſing thoughts (though re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected) than in <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zza</hi>'s haſty catching hold of the <hi>Ark,</hi> or in the <hi>Bethſhemites</hi> looking into it? or is the Lord leſs jealous now than he was? Does his clearer coming under the moſt kindly and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcending Relations, any way abate it? Nay, they rather heighten it, though they may occaſion ſome change in his way of reſenting injuries, and expreſſing his diſpleaſure, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.14. The Lord deals with his people now in a more Son-like way; he chaſtizes them as much or of tner than formerly, but not in that manner: he will keep up his Soveraignty, even when he is owning thy Soul; hee'l have thee know that he muſt be thy Lord, and thou muſt <hi>worſhip him,</hi> Pſalm 45.11. ſo <hi>ſhall the King greatly deſire thy Beauty: for he is thy Lord,</hi> &amp;c. He will not have his kindlieſt Relations diminiſh his Honour, nor wear out our inward awe and fear, leſt an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuitable frame, or any unholy motion of heart ſhould provoke his jealous Eye. It's a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable word, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.58, He will have <hi>his people fear</hi> this glorious and fearful Name, <hi>The Lord thy God;</hi> may be you think <hi>Thy God,</hi> a
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:103420:68"/>ſweet name and a kindly; ay, but he glories in it, and ſo mayeſt thou, and yet ought to be alſo a fearful Name. And truly a Conſcientious care to prevent the very firſt ſtirrings of ſin in the heart, is the moſt genuine fruit, and the moſt ſatisfying evidence of this fear, and of our Covenant-ſtate: Other things may influence and incline us to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſin in its further proceedings; as on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hand, an awful Impreſſion upon the heart of God, as God, and as our God, is of great effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy to keep out ſinful Imaginations: It will make the ſoul not only tremble at yielding to ſuch a ſin as <hi>Joſeph</hi> was ſolicited to, but even ſhrink at the firſt touch of the ſmalleſt temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: and this leads to another direction.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Indeavour to keep thy heart in a holy, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, heavenly and lively frame. What's the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that temptations and ſuggeſtions from Satan do at the firſt excite ſome ſinful motions in the heart? the fundamental reaſon is, our remaining Corruption that they work upon: But the nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt reaſon is, an ill frame; when Satan finds us as dry tinder, he ſtrikes fire, and every part catches and kindles. 1. Then maintain a tender frame, and this will make thee feeling and ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of every inordinate motion of the heart. It will grate upon the Conſcience, and thou wilt be loath by theſe to grieve the ſpirit, as well as by conſenting to, or acting of them, to quench or reſiſt the Spirit: for as the eye is hurt by the ſmalleſt duſt, or ſmoaks, and if it were aware, would ſhut it ſelf againſt them, ſo is it with a tender Conſcience; and if any duſt has got into the eye, it is not at eaſe till it has wept it out,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:103420:69"/>or till it be wipt out: ſo is it alſo with the man who has true tenderneſs of heart. 2. Maintain a lively Spiritual frame; let thy heart be always bending and working towards God: ſtir up ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thoughts and affections, and let thy ſoul be filled with theſe, and there will be no room for ſin to get in; do you not find that ſometimes when the heart is ſtrongly ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ed out to God, that ſinful Imaginations dare ſcarce preſent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: for as we uſe to ſay, that livelineſs in du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties is the way to prevent wandring thoughts in them; and that Birds will not light upon burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sacrifices: ſo it's in this caſe. But when the heart is dead, and cold, and empty, and idle, then Satan and indwelling ſin take their oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity and fill it, and buſie it; he comes and warms it, and kindles fire in it: when therefore any thing is offered to thy eye, or thy ear, or thy taſte, or thy thought, that may excite any inordinacy in thy heart, or in the leaſt meaſure raiſe thy Corruption to ſtir, antidote thy heart, and prepoſſeſs it with ſome gracious Acts. Let the underſtanding, the heart, the affections, the memory; yea, thy ſenſes and outward man, be filled with the fulneſs of God, then ſhall ſin be ſome way out of doors: you ſhall not fulfil the luſts of the fleſh; yea, there ſhall be no room to the luſtings of the fleſh. If thy ſoul be exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in holy meditations and affections, and thy hand be much in heavenly work, if thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe in heaven, and live near God, and dwell on High; were the ſoul always upon the <hi>wing,</hi> and flying heaven-ward, and were God every way <hi>thy all,</hi> Satan durſt not offer to force thee in the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:103420:69"/>preſence of thy Lord and Husband; Satan ſhall not have ſuch acceſs to thee: and this poor world, and its gilded nothings, ſhould not work upon thee: and if the body of death ſhould ſtir, you might with the more eaſe, at leaſt, beat it down. When the Soul is as it were in Gods preſence al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, Satan will not venture ſo to force it, (as it were) <hi>Eſth.</hi> 7.8. Yea, the body of ſin it ſelf would ſhrink into a corner: when the virtue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from the Loadſtone is worn off, the needle wavers hither and thither: but when new touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it bends ſteadily Northward. So it's with the ſoul that's under freſh influences, and that is near God.</p>
            <p>But, 2. How ſhall we do with theſe firſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of ſin? how ſhall we deal with them in their firſt attempts upon us? <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. If any ſin begin to ſtir in thy imagination or mind, look well it get not into thy heart, or affections, for that will inſtantly weaken thy Judgment. 2. If thou would keep thine own Vineyard well, pluck up every weed as ſoon as it appears, elſe it will quickly be overgrown; as ſoon as thou feels ſin ſtir, let thy heart recoil, and ſtart back with ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence: indeed ſin is ſo often ſtirring, that thou may poſſibly weary to be always watching and warring with it: and the heart does ſo eaſily and naturally move that way, that it may poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be a pain to thee to oppoſe it. Therefore thou muſt be armed with a great deal of reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, not to hear the pleadings of the fleſh, nor to parley with a temptation: and know, that when ever ſin ſtirs in thee, thou art under an actual temptation to more ſin. 3. Proteſt and bear
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:103420:70"/>witneſs againſt every motion of ſin in thee: en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thy diſſent from it. And though this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not abſolve thee in the Court of ſtrict-Juſtice, yet the Court of Grace ſhall acquit thee. This was <hi>Paul</hi>'s Goſpel-plea, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.15, 19. and from this he infers, <hi>ver.</hi> 17, and alſo <hi>ver.</hi> 20, Now then it is no more I that do it, but ſin that dwelleth in me: What thou doſt not own, and doſt not conſent unto, God will not charge up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee, ſo as to condemn thee (even as what thou haſt conſented to, if thou haſt retracted it by repentance, he will not bring it in, in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt thee). I do not mean as if there were no need of repentance for theſe, for thou cannot ſincerely proteſt againſt them, if thy heart be not penitent for them. (It's one of the looſe Doctrines of the times, that for leſſer ſins there is a pardon in courſe, and that there needs no repentance); and if thou haſt wilfully betrayed thy ſelf into ſuch occaſions as drew forth theſe acts of ſin, theſe firſt ſtirrings of Corruption, thy ſubſequent diſſent, and cruſhing them, will not ſerve without more particular and ſolemn repentance. I mean therefore ſuch motions of ſin as are excited by the ſuddenneſs and ſubtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of temptations, and ſuch as are the natural and neceſſary effects of the body of ſin, and the hour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly breathings of it. If thou with tears proteſt againſt them, God will not charge them on thee: yet finally, every diſſent from, or diſlike of them, will not diſcharge from the ſin of them: ſome may diſlike them for their tendency, and others as they are troubleſome; But I mean a diſlike of them for themſelves, and proteſting againſt
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:103420:70"/>them, as provoking God, and polluting the ſoul.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Ejaculatory prayer (as its called) is a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table expedient for cruſhing the firſt motions of ſin; we formerly commended ſecret prayer, for the mortification of predominant luſts: But its impoſſible one can have opportunity for ſolemn addreſſes to God, every time they find Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſtirring in them: theſe ſudden motions of ſin muſt have ſome ſpeedier cure; they may be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed and ſmuthered by ſudden ejaculations and deſires ſent up to heaven, which no ſtraitnedneſs as to time, place, or buſineſs need to hinder. They may be in a priſoner before his Judg, in a Courtier when he is ſtanding before his Prince, <hi>Neh.</hi> 2.4. This way of praying, is more eſpecially neceſſary, 1. When thou haſt no opportunity of retiring in ſecret, ſo that thou needs not ſay thou wants time or place, though I fear ſome does with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out neceſſity reſtrain private prayer under the pretext of this. 2. When there is a good mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſtarted in thy heart, that it may be cheriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that a good purpoſe may be kept in the heart for ever. 3. Upon every change of thy Company, and upon leſſer change of what buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs thou art about, when thou goes out and comes in, when thou comes from Company to Solitarineſs, <hi>&amp; e contra:</hi> when thou viſits thy friend, reproves or adviſes him; yea, when ever thou opens thy mouth in Company, or ever thou reſolve on, or promiſe any thing, though it ſeem ſmall and nothing diſputable: many ſuch occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons might be inſtanced. But, 4. That which is to our purpoſe, is, when any ſpark of a temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:103420:71"/>comes in; when Habitual Corruption begins to ſtir, when any corrupt affection does in the leaſt begin to take fire, this is a good way to quench it. This the godly man finds true in fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent experience; but if this doth not, then get into thy ſecret Chamber; this is an honeſt errand to the throne of Grace; caſt thy ſelf down at his feet, and tell him, That if he will trample up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee, let him do it, thou will lay thy hand upon thy mouth, but let not thine enemy and mine oppreſs me, and tread me under: Lord I would not ſin againſt thee, but thou ſeeſt how I am oppreſſed, O undertake for me. Lord, I ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dye at thy foot, than live as Satan and my corrupt heart would have me. Worm <hi>Jacob</hi> that prevailed with him, did not wreſtle upon an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſter account than this is. If thus thou betake thy ſelf to him, thy bow ſhall abide in ſtrength, and thou ſhalt find him <hi>to be ſtrong and mighty in Battel,</hi> Pſal. 24.7, 8. <hi>In the ſecret of his ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle, in his Pavilion ſhall he hide thee, and ſet thee as upon a rock.</hi> Pſal. 27.5. O do not yield to Satan, nor to indwelling-ſin, for it may be ere you riſe off your knees you ſhall have help (to allude to 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11.9). I am ſure <hi>he is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful who has promiſed,</hi> &amp;c. and never any that took his appointed method, that were overcome by a temptation, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.7.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Take the method preſcribed in the Text: You cannot rightly mortifie ſin in its riſe, or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſome progreſs: you cannot mortifie Original ſin, nor your predominant luſts; nay, nor the firſt motions of ſin, but through the ſpirit: <hi>If you walk in the Spirit, you ſhall not fulfil the luſts of
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:103420:71"/>the fleſh,</hi> Gal. 5.16. Sin ſhall never conceive nor bring forth. Now in the beginning I told you, that by the Spirit we may underſtand the graces of the Spirit, by the acting of which, mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is carried on. But, 2. And more eſpecially, The Holy Spirit, by whoſe immediate efficacy ſin is mortified: for the former, I did commend the cheriſhing of grace in the heart, in order to the mortification of Original ſin, and habitual luſts; and did alſo mention it as neceſſary to the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of predominant luſts, That one ſhould indeavour to grow, eſpecially in, and to cheriſh that grace which is moſt directly oppoſite to that ſin. If it be pride, ſet thy ſelf eſpecially to ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy humility; if worldlineſs, heavenly mindedneſs, if paſſion, ſtudy meekneſs; look what ſin is moſt advantaged by your natural temper (for ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily that is the predominant), and ſet your ſelf eſpecially againſt that, elſe it will marr the luſtre of any grace or excellency that may be in thee, and it will keep thee a dwarf in Religion all thy days, and like <hi>Reuben</hi> thou ſhalt never excel; indeed a little grace when any way advantaged by education, or the natural diſpoſition, will go far, and this makes it hard to judg of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative degree; (at leaſt) of other mens gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and oft-times makes men miſ-judg themſelves, or think too highly of themſelves. But when grace is to roll againſt wind and tide both, it had need to be ſtrong; when Original corruption is ſo and ſo advantaged in any of its particular mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</p>
            <p>But as to our preſent purpoſe: when any Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption begins to ſtir in you, if you would
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:103420:72"/>through the Spirit (in this ſenſe) mortifie it, put thy heart inſtantly upon the acting of that grace which is moſt oppoſite thereunto. So the <hi>Pſalmiſt, At what time I'm affraid, I'le truſt in thee:</hi> correct carnal fear by hope and holy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in God. If inordinate worldly ſorrow be ſtirring, labour to beat out of thy heart ſome ſpark of ſpiritual joy. If thy wants or loſſes begin to afflict thee, indeavour to unlock the <hi>Cabinet where thy Jewels and treaſure lies; come ſtudy,</hi> and behold an <hi>All-ſufficient God,</hi> and an <hi>All in all Chriſt.</hi> See if thou miſſes Houſe, or Land, Son, or Daughter, Brother or Siſter here. If thy heart be inclined to run out in carnal, frolick mirth, let deep and ſerious reflections on the ſufferings of Chriſt, without which a ſinful thought could not have been pardoned on a dying hour; and the laſt trumpet, and followng judgment, give check to it. If pride begin to ſtir, go and abaſe thy ſelf; thus ſin ſhall be a loſer by every at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt it makes.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If thou cannot come this length, if thy heart and affections will run out ſo and ſo, then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to alter the objects of them; turn the ſtream a little aſide into another channel, if it will not run in a contrary way; and by this means thou ſhalt alſo mortifie them. If thou find thy heart inclining to paſſion at others, turn it to an holy indignation againſt ſin. If inclined to ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row upon any worldly account, endeavour to turn it into ſorrow for ſin, or for the afflictions and ſufferings of the people of God; let theſe have their due, and thou wilt not have many tears to ſpare for other things. If thy heart be inclining
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:103420:72"/>to exceed in frolick mirth, indeavour to get thy mirth and joy to run into another channel, to turn it into holy joy in God, in Chriſt in his goodneſs to thee, and to his people. Indeed there may be much deceit in this, that thou had need to guard againſt; for as a good diſpoſition ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times paſſes for a ſanctified nature; ſo does theſe, for ſanctified acts and affections; and as the former, when advantaged with grace goes far; ſo theſe high affections when tinctured with grace, paſs for high ſpiritual motions of the ſoul: many un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der affliction miſtake their carnal ſorrow for Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual ſorrow; and others miſtake their natural and occaſional cheerfulneſs, for Spiritual joy; and the reaſon is, becauſe they judg of theſe acts only by the objects, which they thought laſt upon; as for inſtance, May be one under great ſorrow, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termingles with other things, ſome thoughts of ſin, and then he thinks his ſorrow to be god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſorrow; or when in a cheerful frame, or in ſome good mood (as you call it) he intermingles ſome thoughts of God, of Chriſt, of Heaven, and then it paſſes for heavenly joy. Nothing is more ordinary than this: A pregnant inſtance we may have of it in the publick prayers of our forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts, who having by Organs and Muſical Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments excited in themſelves ſome natural affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, put to (may be) ſome thoughts of God and of the joys of Heaven, and thus theſe moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their hearts that are excited by meer na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural cauſes, and their own endeavours, paſs cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent for high ſublime raiſed affections; and this is all the holineſs, and heaven too, of ſome. But here lies the deceit; men look only to the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:103420:73"/>caſual object of their acts, and not at all to the principle of them; nay, nor to the object that did at firſt excite theſe acts, <hi>viz</hi> ſome outward loſs, or ſome outward good (I mean ordinarily). When therefore you would turn na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural or worldly ſorrow into Spiritual, (and ſo with joy) you muſt look well that there be a change, not of the object only, but in the very nature of the acts or affections; for the object a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone is not enough to ſpecifie an action; a meer change of the object will not render a natural affection, or paſſion, Spiritual. There may be much natural Carnal joy in a ſpiritual and ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral object, as <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4; even as there may be a ſpiritual joy, when the immediate object is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and ſo of other affections. If you Object the difficulty of this, and ask, What advantage one has by following this direction? I <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. You have the advantage of being diverted from ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful objects, and from inordinate motions, towards lawful outward objects. 2. You have this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, that when the affections are lively, they move with a greater facility towards ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual objects, though indeed this contributes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to their ſpirituality; ſin and grace they are ſeated in the ſame powers and faculties of the ſoul; and when ſin commands, the more lively theſe powers and faculties be, the more are the actings of ſin advantaged; and ſo it is alſo when grace is uppermoſt, whether in the underſtanding, or the will, or the affections. As on the other hand, when the natural vigour of the ſoul, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of the affections, is gone, or any way ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, the actings of grace in them are not
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:103420:73"/>ſo ſenſible, and ſeem low and faint; hence many aged perſons and others, are apt to conclude hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt themſelves, at leaſt to apprehend a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay of grace when there is none. Therefore when you find any of theſe vigorous and freſh, let grace ſet them on work; and if there be any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular affection more lively and ſtirring than an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, heavenly wiſdom directs us to ſee that that be well employed; and if it be in the hand or poſſeſſion of ſin, to redeem and reſcue it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to its proper uſe: whatever principle or object did firſt move, excite, or draw it forth; the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the ſoul, and all their operations are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of good or evil, as they are uſed: as a ſtrong Caſtle or ſharp ſword may be well or ill uſed; yea, ſuppoſe an uſurping enemy helped to fortifie the Caſtle, or ſharpen the ſword, if they can be taken from him, they may be uſed to the more advantage againſt him.</p>
            <p>Now 2dly, I told you, that by the <hi>Spirit</hi> in the Text, was eſpecially to be underſtood the <hi>holy Spirit,</hi> by whoſe ſpecial aſſiſtance Sin is mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Believer: <hi>If ye through the Spirit,</hi> &amp;c. ſet about this with the Spirits aid, and in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with the methods of the Spirit; which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, 1. Our own impotency: Never think to mortifie any ſin in thy own ſtrength: how ſmall a temptation will overturn us when we ſtand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our own legs! and how ſtrong temptations and inward luſtings are we helped to withſtand and mortifie, when we engage the Spirits aſſiſtance! 2. It imports the ineffectualneſs of meer ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal or moral Conſiderations, Motives, and Means to mortifie ſin; the Conſideration of the turpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:103420:74"/>and infamy of ſin, of its debaſing our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; of that diſtraction and diſorder that inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate paſſions and affections breed in the Soul: the weakneſs and tranſitorineſs of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture comforts, the impoſſibility to recover our loſs by inordinate grief, &amp;c. Theſe may reſtrain or refine ſin, or change the Channel it runs in, but can never mortifie it. Nay, nor 3. Will any means of Gods appointment do it without the Spirit; neither meditation of Death, nor Judgment, nor of the death and ſufferings of Chriſt. Nor will Prayer, or Word, Promiſes, or Threatnings, or Sacraments, or Afflictions, if ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from the Spirits influences and aſſiſtances; This is ſo ſadly verified every day, that I need not prove it. They that want the Spirit, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not mortifie one ſin: and they that improve not an indwelling Spirit, cannot by other means mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie ſin.</p>
            <p>If any object, That ſin doth grieve, and vex, and quench the Spirit, and provoke him to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw; how then doth the Spirit mortifie ſin in us? I anſwer, It's true, that even the ſins of the godly do grieve, and ſome way <hi>quench the Spirit,</hi> But what ſins are theſe? or how do men <hi>quench the Spirit?</hi> It's by their oppoſing the Spirits ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying and mortifying operations. I grant, this may be done by oppoſing his witneſſing and comforting Work, but moſtly the former, which is the chief work of the Spirit. 2. The godly do never ſo <hi>grieve the Spirit,</hi> as to provoke him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together to leave them, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 51.11. There re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main ſome motions and aſſiſtances of the Spirit, which if hearkned to, and improved, may reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:103420:74"/>the Soul again, and bring back more plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and greater aſſiſtances of the Spirit. Firſt then, beware of marring the Spirits work. 2. Learn to comply, and actively to co-operate with the Spirit in all the methods and ways whereby he deſtroys ſin. 3. When ſin is not allowed, the <hi>Spirit is not grieved,</hi> ſo as to withdraw or ſuſpend his operations.</p>
            <p>For the firſt, <hi>Reſist not the Spirit,</hi> elſe the bonds of your ſins ſhall be made ſtrong: <hi>Where the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Lord is, there is Liberty,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.16. This is not a Liberty of ſpeech only or mainly, he works out our freedom and Adoption; but when he is reſiſted or oppoſed, he <hi>brings under bondage to fear</hi> (for both theſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.15, 16, are the effects of the ſame holy Spirit) and brings Adoption under debate again, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.19. 1. O do not counter-act nor counter-work the Spirit: when he diſcovers ſin, do not you ſhut your eyes, or wink hard to hold out his light; ſome will not know Sin, becauſe they have no mind to leave it, much leſs to mortifie it; they put out the Candle, that they may ſin the more freely; ſuch Ignorance does highly aggravate guilt: how many defend their ignorance of Truths and Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Errours and Sins, againſt the Spirit of God? and thus for ſome baſe luſt ſell Truth and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which are glorious Beams of God; and at the higheſt rate and peril, make a Conqueſt of Errour or Sin, which are the excrements of the Devil and of Hell. Oh, to what a height of ſin in this particular, have many arrived at? who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of complying with what Light and Convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions the Spirit does miniſter to them; will have
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:103420:75"/>the Spirit comply with their darkneſs, their Sins and their Errours; when men ſtudy the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to ſeek a cover for them: or get to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Teachers after their own luſts, after the manner of <hi>Achab,</hi> as ordinarily great men eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally do their Miniſters and Chaplains. Thus men would make the Spirit of God of their own mind, and to approve Sin: ſome are angry at the Light, as it mars their carnal Mirth, and as it opens the eyes of others to think of them, what they would not be thought. How many alſo do with the Spirit within, as they do with the Spirit in his Miniſters, and as the <hi>Jews</hi> did with <hi>Jeremy,</hi> Ch. 44, They ſeek Light, but are determined in their mind, only they would have the Spirit to ſerve their turn. 2. Do not not oppoſe the Spirit when drawing the heart off Sin, when engaging and raiſing purpoſes in the heart againſt Sin, or when arming the paſſions againſt it; as many do, who thereby render outward helps for Mortification, and alſo the inward workings of the Spirit, powerleſs and ineffectual; and thus when God would heal them, they diſcover their iniquity as <hi>Ephraim,</hi> and as thoſe do, who not only call <hi>evil, good,</hi> &amp;c. but <hi>draw iniquity like Cart-ropes:</hi> who the more they are ſtriven with, the more they ſtretch themſelves forth to ſin: this is ordinary with the unregenerate.</p>
            <p>But 2dly, Do not <hi>grieve the Spirit</hi> (this is more common to the godly). Now you <hi>grieve the Spirit,</hi> 1. When you covet his Comforts more than his ſanctifying Operations, and his killing of ſin in you. It's worſe to be under the power of Sin, than to be under terrours for ſin. 2. We
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:103420:75"/>
               <hi>grieve the Spirit</hi> by every act of ſin, by the leaſt indulgence to ſin; the very firſt motions of ſin, they are luſtings againſt the Spirit: and the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they proceed, the more they grieve the Spirit; If they be delighted in, or conſented to, which is the conception of ſin, much more if they be brought forth, and amongſt ſins: the more ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual any ſins be, the more it grieves the holy Spirit, as leaving upon the Soul the character and reſemblance of the contrary evil Spirit: As for inſtance, Pride; and the more ſpiritual Pride be, and the more excellent the object of it be, the more provoking it is; though indeed in ſome reſpect ſenſual pleaſures and bodily ſins, may be ſaid to grieve the Spirit more, in as much as they not only defile his Temple, but alſo polute the Soul (which ſhould be the <hi>inner Temple,</hi> and therefore kept more holy), with ſenſual affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which alienates the Soul from the Lord, and which alſo weaken the Soul, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4.11. Hence ſee the oppoſition, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.18. <hi>Jude</hi> 19: and which are a real ſervice and proper tribute to the fleſh: whereas we are debtors only to the Spirit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.12: and it cannot but exceedingly grieve the Spirit, when we pay our livelieſt affections as tribute to his great Enemy in us.</p>
            <p>For the 2d Direction mentioned, <hi>viz.</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance and Co-operation with the Spirit: You muſt not think that the Spirit will mortifie ſin when you are aſleep, or without your own en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, much leſs when you are actually indulg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and giving ſcope to it: <hi>If ye through the Spirit do mortifie,</hi> &amp;c. But ere I preſs this more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, let me exhort you to endeavour as much as in
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:103420:76"/>you lies, to keep your Souls in ſuch a frame as is fit for the holy Spirit to work upon, an humble, meek and ductile frame of ſpirit: the beſt frame will not enable to mortifie any ſin: but when the Lord finds the Soul in a good frame, he works ſuitably upon it, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 27.14: but when there's nothing to work upon, or when the heart is like clamp Tinder: either heavenly ſparks are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held, or they die out.</p>
            <p>And when the Spirit does his part, then be true to yours: when thou art conflicting with ſin, and the Spirit comes in and takes thy part againſt it, happy thou, if thou can improve it. But Oh, ſin not away ſuch bleſſed aſſiſtance; may be, thou ſinds not much of it at firſt, for he uſes to try us with a little, ere he truſt us with much: and as we refuſe or cloſe in with his firſt offers, ſo does he deny, or afford us further aſſiſtance; he gives a little to make way for more. Now, the prejudiced Soul diſcerning that ſuch a motion is levelled at its beloved luſt, which is its life; and foreſeeing the difficulty and pain of Mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, does reject the motion, and refuſe this aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; Even as ſome wretches (ſays one), mar their conceptions, to prevent the pain and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies of Child-bearing: But O, do not hold out theſe Meſſengers, nor murther theſe Births of the Spirit, that would aſſiſt thee in the killing and mortifying of thy ſin. Oh hide not, and plead not for thine Enemy, when the Spirit comes to avenge thee on it, for all the injuries it has done thee: go not forth againſt it in thy own ſtrength, nor yet refuſe to follow him when he gives the Alarm, or the Signal for Battel:
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:103420:76"/>haſtily buckle on thy Armour, and thou ſhalt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail; but if any Temptation meet thee all alone, thou art weak as water: or hadſt thou been as ſtrong as <hi>Sampſon,</hi> if thy locks be ſhaven, and the Spirit be gone, thou wilt <hi>be as other men,</hi> any Cords will now bind thee: Satan will put <hi>out thy eyes, and make thee grind in his Mill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But more particularly, I told you, The Spirits firſt work in reference to the mortification of any Sin, was a particular conviction of it; therefore thy firſt care muſt be to welcom and entertain Convictions of Sin. Take heed of holding out, or ſmuthering divine Light: none ſo hardned in ſin, as ſuch who have oppoſed moſt the Spirit's Light; there is more hope of a man that hath only Natural light, than of him that hath oppoſed much Divine light; and in ſuch oft-times God puts out Natural light; when Men refuſe the greater light, the Lord blows out the leſſer: If they will not ſee with the Sun, he often blows out their Candle; the Goſpel <hi>Maranatha</hi> extinguiſhes it. Hence ſome that have been once enlightned, turn prodigiouſly prophane; and Sin is never ſo ſecure nor ſtrong, than where it has repelled and out-ſtriven moſt Convictions: And alas, Is not the godly mans faint aſſent to, and compliance with the Spirit's light, when <hi>convincing of ſin in them,</hi> the reaſon of many a diſconſolate hour? for when Satan comes to queſtion our ſtate, and the truth of our Grace, we run to a tryal with it, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten can find nothing to repel Satans allegations with; we can ſee nothing but ſins ſet in order be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us: theſe ſtare us in the face, eſpecially our injurious dealing with the holy Spirit of God.
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:103420:77"/>And is it any wonder, that when we comply not with the Spirit's light diſcovering ſin in us, that he deny light, to let us ſee Grace in us? and without his light, we cannot make a clear and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable judgment of our ſtate. If we comply not with his Convincing and reproving Light, we ſhall not have his comforting Light; and it's upon this account that many poor Souls under trouble and exerciſe, are not able to diſcern any gracious fruits of the Spirit in themſelves, but their eyes are held poring upon the fruits of the fleſh, upon thoſe ſins eſpecially whereby they have grieved the Spirit; when the Spirit ſays to the Soul, as <hi>Reuben</hi> did to his Brethren in their ſtrait, <hi>Spake I not unto you,</hi> &amp;c? You are now in trouble and under terrors; But did not I tell you? did not I admoniſh you? the <hi>Spirit helps our ſpirits</hi> to repeat the good motions and the charming-Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that we repelled: and be ſure Satan will not fail to act his part at ſuch a time.</p>
            <p>Oh ſay not to the Clouds, Drop not; and to the Winds, Blow not; and to the <hi>Seers, See not; and to the Prophets, Prophecy not; and to the Spirit, Convince not, Reprove not.</hi> For the Spirit not only admoniſhes men of ſin, but argues with them: as the word imports, <hi>John</hi> 16.8. But ſome other liſten not, or elſe endeavour to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the Spirit's arguments, or to oppoſe carnal Reaſons to them.</p>
            <p>But if thou would <hi>through the Spirit</hi> mortifie any ſin, caſt open thy doors and windows to the Spirit's Light; the Spirit often darts in Beams of Tormenting light, whether men will or not: but he does not mortifie ſin, whether men will or not.
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:103420:77"/>Oh be thankful for heavenly Light; put thy finger now upon thy ſin, and hold it there: may be, thou haſt formerly known ſuch a thing to be a ſin, but now thou haſt an opportunity to know the <hi>exceeding ſinfulneſs</hi> of it. And truly, the Spirit's light does leave that impreſſion of the <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of ſin</hi> (as the firſt effect of it), which if loſt once, is not eaſily recovered again: And if this impreſſion upon the Mind be loſt or leſſened, it will be ſo with any effect left, or impreſſion the Spirit made upon the heart or affections, or any further endeavours to mortifie ſin.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Comply with the Spirit of God, when he begins to affect the heart with godly ſorrow for ſin, <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.10. The firſt kindly effect of a thorow Conviction, and of a right ſight of the <hi>ſinfulneſs of ſin,</hi> is ſorrow; the Conviction of the Righteouſneſs of God, and of the guilt of Sin, breeds fear; the Convictions of the holineſs of God, and of the uglineſs of ſin, breeds a holy ſhame; the Convictions of the graciouſneſs of God in Chriſt, and of the injuriouſneſs of ſin to the grace of God in Chriſt, breeds godly ſorrow, according to that paſſage, <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.10, 11: where this ſorrow is mentioned as the firſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and ſenſible fruit of the <hi>pouring out of the Spirit.</hi> Oh, beware you loſe not that firſt Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion that a thorough ſight of ſin makes: all thy ſmiting and hammering upon thy heart will not recover it. And according to your meaſure of this, ſo may you judg what meaſure of the Spirit you have: you who are whole and unbro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, you have none of the Spirit; and it's a ſign the <hi>body of death</hi> is whole and found: I do not
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:103420:78"/>mean you, who may be cannot mourn; deep ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row ſometimes cauſes deep thoughts of heart, when leſs ſorrow will have more tears; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore look you miſs not this proper and kindly ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of right Convictions: let not the Spirit's work ſtop here. Some leap over this ſtep, they are moved by ſome Convincing work of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit's to forſake and relinquiſh ſin; but ſin cannot be mortified, till the heart be imbittered againſt it: the Spirit affects the heart with a fenſe of ſins acceſſion to Chriſts death, and puts the Soul to ſeek a Revenge, and nothing but the death of ſin will ſatisfie it. Oh, cheriſh godly ſorrow, if you would morifie ſin; think it not a legal frame, when the Spirit moves thee to go alone, and makes Company and buſineſs burthenſom to thee, and begins to melt thy heart: take hold of the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, thou knows not the meaning of the Spirit; when there is ſome ſorrow ſeeking a vent, fall thou to pump it out: yet think not that tears will drown ſin, they ſometimes feed it, and make it more fruitful: but where they flow from a broken heart, they tend to the death of Sin.</p>
            <p n="3">3. When the Spirit moves thy heart againſt Sin, and excites hatred, diſtaſte and indignation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſin, and ſtirs up thy anger againſt it, blow upon the Coal. Some let <hi>not the Sun go down upon their anger</hi> at it, ſuch are not true to the Spirit of God; his Controverſie with ſin is like that with <hi>Amaleck,</hi> for ever. When the <hi>Spirit is luſting againſt the fleſh, and the fleſh againſt the Spirit,</hi> joyn thou with the Spirit: Now thou haſt an advantage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſin, which if thou improve, may tend more to the death of ſin, than many months or years
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:103420:78"/>of thy ſingle endeavours, or fruitleſs formal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints. Purſue the advantage thou haſt, and preſs hard upon ſin; If the <hi>new Nature</hi> in thee cannot bear ſin, and when its weak, and the Spirit comes into its aſſiſtance, how glad ſhould thou be, and how welcom ſhould this aid be, when the Spirit diſcovers ſin, excites the heart and affections too againſt it? If you will now awake your ſelf as the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> when his heart is fixed, and when he has awaked his <hi>tongue and his harp,</hi> Pſalm 57.7, 8, <hi>I my ſelf alſo will awake;</hi> You may cut the ſinews of your predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant ſin: but if you ſhrink back, and comply no further with the Spirit than your carnal eaſe or intereſt will admit, you cannot but look for the withdrawing of the Spirit, and the preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of ſome evil Spirit. And ſuppoſe you only reſiſted the Spirit in ſome things, you cannot but think it righteous, that he ſhould not afford you his aſſiſtance in other things: but leave you to your own luſts, and to the ſwing of your own hearts.</p>
            <p>When the Spirit then does animate thee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt any ſin, hath bended thy heart, and raiſed or corroborated holy reſolutions againſt it: maintain them (for the heart is naturally like a miſcarrying womb); pray as 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.18, and fall inſtantly on the mortifying of that ſin. Holy endeavours ſtrengthen holy purpoſes: and if theſe be vigorous and ſtrong, thou mayeſt now get over the difficulties that uſed to hinder the mortification of that ſin, and may do ſo hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: that is, may hinder hereafter, if through delays, or neglect of preſent endeavours, you let not your purpoſes cool or ſlacken; whereas proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:103420:79"/>if this difficulty be overcome, thy Conqueſt of ſin may ever after go better on: But do not think, that when you are aided by the Spirit, you ſhall meet with no difficulties, or that becauſe of ſins vigorous oppoſition, you are not influenced or aided by the Spirit. There is no War without trouble, and difficulty, and danger; the Spirit does not altogether remove difficulties: the <hi>luſting of the Spirit</hi> does not extinguiſh the <hi>luſting of the fleſh;</hi> yea, the Spirit may be ſtirring the heart, even when the fleſh is prevailing: the groans of a holy Soul, even when overcome by ſin, are from the Spirit; but it's the Spirit's work to help over theſe difficulties which were otherwiſe inſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; and this he will do, if there be no failing on our part. But ah! the Spirit's aid meets with ſuch oppoſition and reluctancy from the Soul in ſo far as it is unrenewed, that neither ſpiritual purpoſes nor endeavours can be mantain'd and kept up without ſtriving and earneſt contending on our part: and this muſt be done, maugre our eaſe, humour, and the mighty oppoſition of the <hi>body of death.</hi> He that would not be worſted by ſin, muſt <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

               </gap>. <hi>Luke</hi> 13.24, <hi>Strive as in an Army:</hi> there's no ſtriving with other things that will put the Soul in an Agony, ſet aſide Sin: there's no difficulty beſides this in the way to Heaven; ſee <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.4. The power of ſin will put any ſenſible Soul in an agony, as well as the guilt of it; <hi>Paul</hi> ſeems acquainted with it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.24: and no doubt he had much of the Spirit, even when he thus cryed out. Do not then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect ſuch aſſiſtance from the Spirit, as will kill thy Corruption at one ſtroke: the truer thou
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:103420:79"/>art to thy help, the more thou ſhall have; and the more the Spirit does, the more thou muſt do.</p>
            <p n="4">4. When the Spirit (who is a ſpirit of ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) does ſtrongly influence thy heart in Prayer, improve it unto the mortification of ſin, for the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity and uſefulneſs of Prayer in reference to Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, I have ſpoke to already, and now urge the improvement of the Spirit's aſſiſtance in Prayer, as one of thoſe ways whereby <hi>through the Spirit</hi> we are to mortifie ſin. And in order to this, whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver meaſure of the Spirit's aid and aſſiſtance thou haſt, let thy Prayers be chiefly levelled againſt ſin: and that not only nor moſtly againſt the guilt of ſin, but eſpecially againſt the power of ſin. Nature may raiſe the deſires of freedom from guilt high, which may be miſtaken for the influence of the Spirit It is true, that Natural ſelf-love may alſo draw out ſtrong deſires of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from the power of ſin, as their paſſions and corrupt contradictory luſts and affections do mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt and trouble them: but eſpecially as they know them to be inconſiſtent with any well-grounded hope of Heaven; as for unregenerate mens uſual formal Petitions for deliverance from temptations, and from the power of their ſins, there is ordinarily not ſo much as moral ſincerity in them (even when that may be in their Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for Pardon) they really would not that God ſhould hear them, and are ſometimes afraid he ſhould; ſo that what <hi>Auguſtine</hi> confeſſeth of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf before his Converſion, is indeed a Common Caſe.</p>
            <p>But to return, When the Spirit makes inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion in thee, helps thee to make interceſſion
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:103420:80"/>
               <hi>with groans which cannot be uttered:</hi> Let theſe <hi>groans</hi> be againſt ſin, rather than for Divine Comforts. Groan rather for Redemption from ſin, than from any other miſery: do you <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

               </gap> with the Spirit, as the Apoſtle beſeeches the <hi>Romans, for the love of the Spirit, to do with him,</hi> Rom. 15.13; we render it, <hi>Strive together: the Spirit makes interceſſion with groans,</hi> as if he were in an Agony; O for the love of the Spirit, ſtrive together with him, &amp;c. And when the Spirit gives greater enlargement, and mightily draws out the heart in Prayer; know, that then the Lord is ſaying to the Soul, as it were, What is thy Requeſt? Thou haſt now got the King's Ear, then let thy Requeſt be the death of thy ſins: and amongſt all thy ſins, eſpecially, that he would give thee the head of thy greateſt luſt that has moſt diſhonoured God, and done the moſt miſchief, that has often left thee wounded and groaning. Now thou haſt an opportunity to be rid of it, and avenged on it, purſue thy advantage, and return not from the purſuit till thou haſt divided the ſpoil: thou may now get more ground of ſin, than by many years praying againſt it in thine own ſpirit; when your prayer is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

If it do not inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kill ſin, and deliver thee from ſuch a Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet it avails much to the death of it: and if continued in, thy ſin ſhall not ſo far prevail, as to mar thy acceptance with God; or Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:103420:80"/>with him, or darken thy evidence for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
            <p n="5">5. If you would by the Spirit mortifie ſin, comply with the Breathings and influences of the Spirit in Ordinances, in the Word &amp; Sacraments: This were the way (ſays one) to make Ordinances, and the times alſo glorious; the Apoſtle uſeth the dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of Chriſt, and of the Word in us, promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuouſly; men grieve the Spirit when they deſpiſe the Word, or any helps that God hath given them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 7.13: they are the means whereby the Spirit diſcovers ſin, purges it away, or kills it, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 119.9, and 107.20. <hi>John</hi> 15.3, and 17.17. <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.12: Render them not powerleſs to your Souls, by letting the Impreſſions that the Spirit has made by them, wear out: Has the Lord by his Word and Spirit diſcovered ſin to you? fix your thoughts upon it, and pry more and more into the ſinfulneſs of it. Muſe upon it till your heart be hot within you: and till your heart be fired with anger, indignation and zeal againſt it; and when the Word makes your <hi>heart burn within you,</hi> blow upon the Coal that it die not out again; you muſt <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the Spirit ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times wounds the Soul for ſin, and makes ſome word like an Arrow, pierce the heart: but Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners pluck it out again, and lick their wound whole again, and thus ſin is whole again; ſin puts the Soul between the ſtroke and it: whereas, when the Spirit by the Word ſmites, we ſhould expoſe ſin to it, and be content to have it not only diſcovered, but beaten and left dead upon the place; be content to find the Word as <hi>a two-edged ſword;</hi> and love thoſe beſt, in whoſe mouth
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:103420:81"/>is the ſharpeſt ſword; and hold up thy ſins to its ſtrokes when they are found out; Be content that the Word be as a Corroſive-plaiſter to thee, and keep it cloſe upon the ſore place.</p>
            <p>O how many have their judgments enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Spirit in Ordinances: but they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſon Light, impriſon Truths, and ſuffer not the power of them to reach their hearts and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections. True, ſome find alſo the heart ſhaken and troubled for ſin, and reſolutions raiſed againſt it, yet it is not mortified, all miſcarryes: and why? Truly, becauſe in ſome theſe have no root; and for others that are truly godly, they yet take not pains enough with their own heart, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain what the Spirit by the Word has wrought in them: they labour not to drive the Nail to the head, and to keep the Bow in bent. Slothfulneſs is a ſlighting of the Spirit, and provokes him to withdraw; and when the Sun is gone, light and heat is quickly gone. When the Spirit does by any Ordinance animate you againſt ſin, and fix it upon your heart to ſeek the death of any ſin, give it no reprieval for an hour: give not Satan time to tempt thee, nor ſin time to prepare ſome charm to entice thee again: let not theſe things that uſe to choak the Word, deface and obliterate ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Impreſſions; if when the Spirit by the Word has heated your affections, you immerſe your ſelf in your buſineſs, this like froſty Air will ſoon cool you; if you do unwarily meddle with it, it will quickly take off your edg; and they are the moſt dangerous colds that come after great heats: hence many not only abate their zeal againſt ſin, but ſin is advantaged by this means; the heart
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:103420:81"/>like the earth which in Winter is thawed by the Sun at Noon, freezes the harder the next Night. 6. Obſerve, and comply with the Spirits moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and methods when under affliction, which is a ſpecial ſeaſon of the Spirits teaching and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: afflictions uſe to be the Seal to Gods Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, <hi>Job</hi> 33.16. Seals give weight and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to Writings; the Spirit now ſets Inſtructions home. Therefore conſider what ſin thou haſt moſt need to mortifie, and what the Lord does eſpecially aim at in afflicting thee: and in order to this, obſerve what his Spirit did charge moſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee before affliction came; and mark how the Lord follows affliction: the Spirit uſes to bear in ſome ſin more eſpecially, and to make a mans Conſcience deal impartially with him; hear what that ſays eſpecially after Prayer; and when the Spirit by afflictions does humble thee, and cauſe heavineſs in thee, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5, let not ſin raiſe up it ſelf; for thou canſt never riſe again, but upon its ruins; and when the ſpirits work tends to the ſtirring up of Grace, in all thy acting of Grace, have an eye upon the ſin that has moſt indan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered thee, and comply with the ſpirit, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially when thou art moved to the acting of that Grace that is moſt contrary to thy ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt Corruption. It's a token of a ſanctified af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, when thy ſin is diſcovered in its ſinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: when there is fixed purpoſes of heart rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed againſt it, and when there is ſome notable acting of the Grace that is moſt oppoſite to it excited.</p>
            <p>And now when the lot is fallen upon it, do not ſpare it, do not think to roll it to ſhore, and ſave
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:103420:82"/>it alive, do with it as the <hi>Jews</hi> did with <hi>Paul,</hi> Act. 21.28, <hi>They laid hands on him, crying out, Men of Iſrael help, This is the man that teacheth the people againſt the law, and hath polluted this holy place.</hi> Labour to fix your thoughts, and purpoſes, and affections you now have; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards be often asking thy ſoul, what is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of them? and deal with ſin as then you wiſhed you had never done.</p>
            <p>I ſhall in the next place anſwer ſome Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt what has been delivered. And, 1.

Look thou be not like a ſtanding Pool, that has more mud and dirt at the bottom, than the raging Sea; and indeed ſin is never more ſtirring than when it ſeems aſleep, or moves ſmoothly: thou art not yet come the young mans length, <hi>Mark</hi> 10. who may be has outdone thee in every thing, yet ſaw there was ſomething lacking; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed beſides faith in Chriſt, there was mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the world wanting. 2. How came thou by this freedom from ſin, and ſo much inward quiet? thou muſt be in League with Hell; ſure I am, the holieſt Chriſtians make ſad complaints
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:103420:82"/>of ſin within, and temptations without, and ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom want ſome excerciſe; but it ſeems you let ſin live, and ſin lets you live. 3. It's a token that ſin has never been irritated, much leſs ſlain; we know thou art not pure by nature, more than others; nor can education purge out ſin, though it may qualifie it; and we know that it cannot be mortified with much ado, ſuch an intereſt has it got in the ſoul. But here it is, the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment has never come in its ſpirituality and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to thee; till then <hi>Paul</hi> troubled himſelf as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle with ſin as thou doſt: ſin prevails in the heart, yet is not grievous, becauſe there's no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in thee that is contrary to it, to oppoſe it. It's but a ſhort way that a natural Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence goes; it charges no man with Original cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, nor with the firſt motions of ſin, that the body of ſin breaths out every moment, and which the ſmalleſt temptation will excite. And in many, reaſon, and conſcience, and affection, and all is in bondage to ſin; and there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to preſent its proceedings, but there's a thorough ſatisfaction with its ſervitude. Sin is in thee, as in its proper place, and therefore feels not heavy. 4. Thou mayeſt eaſily miſtake, when thou compares thy ſelf with others, whoſe Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſome ſharp tryals, or ſtrong temptations, has brought forth; there may be much more ſin at bottom in thee. 5. Know that ſuch as Satan has poſſeſſion of, he does not ſo much trouble them, he cares not how peaceably they come to hell; he laſhes few till they begin to turn out of his road; he cares not how neat a way they come to hell, nor how ſwept, and clean the houſe be,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:103420:83"/>and how well garniſhed. There may be acceſs and room for the more evil ſpirits. And truly I think, that Satan may be as careful to keep temptations from ſome, leſt they ſhould be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcovered to themſelves and to others, as he is to multiply temptations to others; here's the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of many: God bindeth them, and Satan bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them, and they cry not: God blinds men, and Satan blinds men, and they feel not, diſcern it not, and will not believe it, <hi>Joh.</hi> 9.39, 40. He hardens them, and they know not how; the ſtone in the heart grows as inſenſibly, as the ſtone in the bladder.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Some Carnal hearts may object the pain that is in mortifying a ſin that's dear and uſeful; and that to mortifie ſin, is to mortifie mirth. This has been formerly obviated. In ſhort, you muſt know, 1. That this is not the proper time nor place for mirth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.20, <hi>Ye ſhall weep and lament, but the world ſhall rejoyce;</hi> and when we rejoyce, our mirth muſt not be a-kin to theirs. We read but once, that Jeſus rejoyced in ſpirit, <hi>and that was not with the joy of this world,</hi> Luk. 10.21. <hi>He was a man of ſorrows,</hi> and it becomes not his Diſciples to be men of mirth. I ſpeak this the rather, becauſe that under pretence of removing an occaſion of offence, and ſtumbling of ſome at the way of God, many drown themſelves in Carnal mirth. No man comes leaping and laughing to heaven; then, and not till then ſhall all tears be wip't a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; were there none, there needed no wiping; as long as ſin is not throughly purged away, ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row muſt not fly away. 2. There is indeed pain and trouble in mortifying ſin, as there is in cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:103420:83"/>off a living member of the body, and as there is in the rending of the ſoul from the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; for ſin cleaves as cloſe to the ſoul and to the body, as the ſoul and body doth to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Yet, 3. This pain is only, or at leaſt more eſpecially at ſome times; as when a man firſt ſets about the mortification of ſin: But when ſin has once begun to fall before him, he is heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and his work goes more eaſily on, and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties fly away. 4. It is the being of ſin, and the ſtrength of ſin that breeds trouble, and grief, and pain to the godly man: not ſo much the mortifying of ſin, for that relieves him. 5. As we formerly told you, there's a great deal of more pain in ſerving and ſatisfying any luſt, than in mortifying it, <hi>Job</hi> 20.22. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.29, 30. Would you ſet about the mortification of ſin, and make tryal, you ſhould find it ſo: The reaſon why men think not their luſts burdenſome, is their love to them; and their being habituated to them, diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gages the affections to them, and they torment a man; that which makes them ſweet, is the vicious conſtitution of their ſouls and bodies; when a man is recovered of his diſeaſe, they are like gall and wormwood to him; that which leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſens their trouble and pain in ſerving of them, is their imputing it to the ſcantneſs of proviſion for them; whereas when they have multiplied and diverſified the objects of them, they are ne're the nearer ſatisfaction in them. 6. <hi>Man is born to affliction, as the ſparks flie upward;</hi> and if the godly man find pain and trouble in mortifying ſin, he has reſt in the evil day to compenſate that. If ſin be mortified, it's eaſie to bear a croſs; if
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:103420:84"/>ſin be dead, it's eaſie for a man to die. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as others are uneaſie under afflictions, and on a death bed, unmortified ſin makes a man feeling of affliction; the trouble and pain of it is more than the pleaſure of ſin, and more than the pain of mortification; and how much more does the pain and ſorrow of hell exceed theſe? Will you chuſe to pine away in pain, rather than let a gangrene Limb be cut off, or a broken Limb be ſet again? Will you lye a million of years in tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ere you indure a moments pain? the odds is not ſo great, as between time and Eternity. 7. Where there is a principle of true Grace, it's greater pain to the new man to ſin, then to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie ſin. 8. It is no pain or trouble to a man, in ſo far as he is renewed, to oppoſe and morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie ſin; he does it with delight, and the more effectually he do it, the more is his peace and joy. 9. If at any time ſin prevails, the heart is drawn forth into acts of godly ſorrow, and indeed the godly man chuſes that before the worlds mirth, and therefore cheriſhes it; whereas the trouble and anguiſh others have, is a kin to that of hell, which makes them ſhun it, and fly from it. Yea, 10. The very trouble which the mortification of ſin breeds to the old man, is a pleaſure to the new; then one riſes upon the ruins of the other: and when he conſiders what aſſurance of a final conqueſt he has, he is heartned, he knows that the death of ſin is his life, that if he through the ſpirit mortifie ſin, he ſhall live; he can bear to have a right hand cut off, when his life is at the ſtake; and if he feel pain, and trouble, and complain of it, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.24, he checks himſelf
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:103420:84"/>next word, and turns his moan into a Song, <hi>Act.</hi> 25. &amp; 8.1.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Some object the impoſſibility of mortifying ſuch and ſuch Corruptions; ſome will acknowledg a ſelf-denyed and mortified life to be the beſt life; but ſay you, No body knows my tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and circumſtances; there's ſuch a woful proneneſs in my nature to ſuch and ſuch things, that I know not how to withſtand it, though I have prayed, and reſolved, and hoped againſt it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It's true, thou art utterly impotent, and by thy own endeavours thou cannot mortifie any ſin; but art thou a Chriſtian, and haſt no faith? or in Chriſt, and haſt thou not the ſpirit of Chriſt: Haſt thou Chriſt in thee, and the Spirit of the living God in thee, and yet no ſtrength, or cannot mortifie a beloved luſt by it? But does not this excuſe them that want the Spirit, and his ſpecial aſſiſtance? <hi>Anſw.</hi> No, 1. Becauſe ſome ſuch, at leaſt, think they can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt and overcome many ſins, and yet do not; why do they put off Repentance and Mortification, with expreſs purpoſes ſome other time to repent, and mortifie ſin? and why do they, when under outward trouble, or inward terrors, cry out, O that I had known this. 2. They will not ſo much as try whether they can mortifie ſin or not. 3. The natural man does not only freely and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, but chearfully fulfil the luſts of the fleſh, without regard to, or ſenſe of his Impotency to do otherwiſe, or any neceſſity he is under, ſaving what he lays upon himſelf: they could not do it more freely, ſuppoſing there were no pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er

               </gap> a willingneſs and ſatisfaction in ſo doing: and thus they do willingly conſent to the want of the Spirits aſſiſtance, that's neceſſary to the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of ſin. And, 4. They are even willing that there be inſuperable difficulties in their way, that they cannot mortifie ſins; they are ſo in love with their luſts, that they are content to have their ear bored, and to be ſervants to them for ever; they love to have it ſo, <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.31. and are grieved when their crazy bodies cannot ſerve their ſinful, Ambitious, Covetous, Vindictive ſouls; yea, it may be they are glad that they have this pretence of impotency to plead for themſelves; and it being ſo univerſal, they think their plea will be the more relievant.</p>
            <p>But, 5. That which may ſtop every mouth is this, You do not what you may do, for the mortification of ſin; ſure I am, If you cannot get the better of a vain, proud, light heart, you may yet reſtrain your tongue, and rectifie your garbs. But O, when poor Miniſters cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with you, for Chriſts ſake, to cut off the ſuperfluities of your own, or others hair, and to forſake ſinful and fooliſh faſhions, which any may do with much eaſe: how ſhall we prevail with you to cut off a right hand, to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don what is as dear to you as your life, and what cleaves cloſer to you than a girdle
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:103420:85"/>does to the loyns of a man, or the ſoul does to the body?</p>
            <p>In a word, how much might you have done to the mortification of ſuch or ſuch a luſt, that you have neglected? ſo that this pretence of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency, is but a froward Objection of the fleſh: for (as an excellent man ſaith) the Spirit is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver before-hand with us, preventing us with ſome knowledg, and ſome ability, which if we joyn with, the Spirit is ready to increaſe, and carry us further. If the Lord concur to thoſe works to which he does not previouſly move the heart; how much more to thoſe works which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites, and is the firſt mover? The holy Lord fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows the worſt of men, a great way; but they will have none of him; ſo that the Queſtion, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God will condemn the man that did his ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, ought to be out of doors, for no man out of Chriſt, ever did all that he could by common aſſiſtance of the Spirit.</p>
            <p>But is not the godly man heartily willing to be rid of ſin, when yet he cannot? <hi>Anſw.</hi> As the unrenewed will is Chriſts greateſt enemy, and Satans greateſt ſtrength; ſo indeed, much of the ſtrength of Grace lies in the renewed will, and in the new man. It's Chriſts greateſt friend, and ſins greateſt enemy, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.17, 23, <hi>The heart may be willing, when the fleſh is weak.</hi> And when there is ſome defect and ſhort-coming in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutive powers of the ſoul, our diligence in du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and actual oppoſition to ſin, ſeldom or never an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the deſires of a willing mind, or of an inlarged heart. Yet, 1. Know, that there is ſome wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs; were the will perfectly ſet againſt ſin,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:103420:86"/>a man ſhould be perfectly holy. <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 7, ſpeaks only of his renewed will, or his will in ſo far as renewed; for its certain his will was in part for evil, elſe he could not have done it; true, there was force as it were on the renewed will (therefore he pleads Not guilty in ſome fenſe); but this was by the unrenewed will, in part, though more eſpecially by the inferior ſoul. 2. The believer, if he quench not the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, yet is often grieving him, and ſo provokes him to ſuſpend his aſſiſtance. And I judg we may ſay, This the holy Spirit rarely or never does, but after ſome unkind uſage. 3. None of them are deſtitute of all aſſiſtance againſt ſin; and they are culpable in ſo far as they improve not theſe, and in as far as they do not conſcienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſhun all provocations to ſin, and uſe all Gods appointed means and methods, with which the ſpirit uſes to concur, and whereby he conveys ſupplies of grace and ſtrength to the ſoul.</p>
            <p>If any ask how this neceſſary aſſiſtance of the Spirit may be obtained? I <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Negative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Do not reſiſt the Spirit. 2. Quench not the Spirit. 3. Grieve not the Spirit. 2. Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, 1. You muſt be convinced of your utter impotency to mortifie any ſin. 2. You muſt highly prize the Spirit's aſſiſtance, and thirſt and hunger for it, as a child for bread to nouriſh him. 3. You muſt pray for the Spirit, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.13, <hi>Your hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father will give the Spirit,</hi> &amp;c. See how the Diſciples were buſied, <hi>Act.</hi> 1.14, <hi>Prayer brings down the Spirit,</hi> and the more of this Spirit, the more prayer. Or the Lord will have ſuch as have none of the Spirit, yet to ſeek him by pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:103420:86"/>
               <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.27. compared with <hi>v.</hi> 37. Indeed there is no promiſe that God will give his ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Spirit, to every unrenewed man that asks him: that of <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.13, concerns only children, and a further meaſure of the Spirit. But if thou haſt any thing of the Spirit, the way to get more is by believing-prayer. I ſay, by believing-pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: compare <hi>Act.</hi> 1.4. with 8.14. See alſo <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.30, 31. though thou find not much of this, yet <hi>believe the promiſe, and wait.</hi> O it's not known what advantage there is in believing promiſes! <hi>Joh.</hi> 11.20. There is ſome preſent ſtrength that accompanies this, and more that certainly follows it. 4. Improve what meaſure of the Spirit you have, were it but on the account of that general promiſe, <hi>Matt.</hi> 25.21. and <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.23, <hi>Turn ye at my reproof; and behold, I'le pour out my ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit upon you:</hi> be content that the Spirit ſhould not only dwell in you, but influence and act you. <hi>Walk after the ſpirit,</hi> that what <hi>Paul</hi> ſays of Chriſt, you may ſay of the Spirit, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. and of Grace, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.10. Think it no bondage, but true liberty, to be led by the Spirit; happy they, who are ever in ſuch a frame as are fit for the Spirit to operate upon. Indeed it requires careful attention to obſerve, and much humility and ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denyal to walk by the Spirit. O let not convictions cool, nor holy motions die; turn every motion againſt ſin into a purpoſe, and every purpoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to endeavours againſt ſin. Attend diligently on Ordinances, <hi>Act.</hi> 10.44, <hi>While Peter yet ſpake theſe words, the Holy-Ghoſt fell on all them that heard the word.</hi> But mark what's ſaid, <hi>ver.</hi> 33, <hi>Now therefore we are all here preſent before God,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:103420:87"/>to hear all things that are commanded thee of God.</hi> Thou muſt ſee thy ſelf as in the preſence of God; and get a heart ready to receive his Inſtructions or Commands.</p>
            <p>Finally, If thou haſt loſt that aid of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that thou waſt wont to have, ſearch how thou came to loſe it; If there be not ſome ſecret luſt that thou waſt willing to ſpare: this may not only undo thy comforts, but univerſally marr the Spirits operations. May be there is ſome old reckonings which were never diſtinctly counted for, nor ſcored off, which the Spirit has brought to your remembrance, and yet you will needs bury them. But ordinarily its ſomething in thy preſent frame or way, and may be it's ſomething that you think but little of (often the cauſe of Gods Controverſie with a land, or with a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſon, is that which we would little ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect); may be a fretful, unbelieving, or injurious thought; take heed to the firſt motion of ſin; for ſin has no bound (ſays one), but what the Spirit puts to it, whom therefore we ſhould not oppoſe, but kindly intreat; therefore look to thy thoughts, and to thy words: (ſee the Gonnexion, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.29, 50.) eſpecially in carnal company, whoſe converſe mightily cheriſhes theſe ſins in us which we ſhould mortifie; and by complying with, or gratifying their ſpirits, we often wound our own, and grieve Gods Spirit; and thus give ſin ſome reprieval. We cannot converſe with ſuch, but they will either afflict us, or defile us; look di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently then into thy carriage, and remember when and where the Spirit began to withdraw his uſual aids: and when you have found out
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:103420:87"/>the cauſe, 1. You muſt by renewed acts of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repentance, and faith, be reconciled to God through Jeſus Chriſt: for the beſtowing of the Spirit is an eminent fruit of the ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt, and of the favour of God, and is not given to dwell in the ſoul, and habitually to aſſiſt, till one be firſt reconciled to God; and expect no new gift of the Spirit, till thou haſt made up thy peace again with God through Chriſt. 2. Beware of that way, in the beginning of which thou found the Spirit begin to leave thee: if thou think that this requires great circumſpection and heedfulneſs, it being a matter of ſuch infinite ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to thy ſoul, thou needs not think ſtrange that it ſhould; eſpecially conſidering how care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful thou art to keep ſome friend here, and what diligent endeavours thou uſes to provide or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a little of this worlds goods, that will not go far with thee; and wherein thou haſt not ſuch aſſurance of ſucceſs: <hi>for thou mayeſt riſe ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and eat the bread of ſorrow all the day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the laſt place, Let us ſpeak a little to ſome few caſes: And I begin with that touched upon in the third Objection, <hi>viz.</hi> the caſe of ſuch as complain of the ſtrength of their corruptions. If their mortification of ſin be ſo neceſſary to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; alas! what ſhall I think of my ſelf, who am ſo much under the power of this or that cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> There are ſeveral degrees of the power and prevalency of ſin. 1. The higheſt degree of it is, when men voluntarily yield themſelves as ſervants to it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.16, <hi>Know ye not that to whom ye yield your ſelves ſervants to obey, his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:103420:88"/>ye are to whom ye obey, whether of ſin unto death,</hi> &amp;c. when men are agents in reſigning them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves up to ſin; as ſervants tender their ſervice to their maſter, they do not explicitely intend to be captives, but it neceſſarily follows, and they are willing ſufferers or patients under it: the word uſed for Chriſts giving himſelf for us, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.25. and committing himſelf to God as judg, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.23. is uſed of ſome mens giving themſelves o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to Laſciviouſneſs, to work uncleanneſs with greedineſs, or in abundance, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.19. this is the caſe of unrewed man, whoſe heart and will is for ſin, and who do manifeſt an utter want of mortification: from this degree of ſin the Apoſtle acquits the <hi>Romans,</hi> ver. 17.18. 2. There is a lower degree of it, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.19, <hi>Of whom a man is overcome, of the ſame is he brought into bondage.</hi> This <hi>being overcome,</hi> imports ſome oppoſition, yet not what is ſufficient. 3. Another degree of the power of ſin we find, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.23, <hi>I ſee another law in my members, warring againſt the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of ſin, which is in my members.</hi> Where we ſee the law of ſin is not in the mind or will, but in the members; that is, the carnal affections. Grace has beat ſin out of the higher powers of the ſoul, and it has fortified it ſelf as it were, in the affections, and in the nether part of the ſoul. And obſerve, that here the Captivity is not a leading to outward acts of ſin, but a bowing down the power of the mind, and a weakning of the actings of Grace in the mind and will, and impeding the lively effects of Grace in the heart.</p>
            <pb n="169" facs="tcp:103420:88"/>
            <p>Now judg which of theſe is your caſe: the firſt cannot be the caſe of any godly man: ſuch as are under it, mortifie not ſin, but the Convictions of Conſcience, and the common motions of the Spirit; and herein they are often ſucceſsful: whereas a Believer accuſes himſelf, and joyns ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively with the Spirit, to <hi>convince of ſin,</hi> and to mortifie it, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 51.1, 21. <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.5, 6. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions come on them, and they tremble and ſeek to be rid of them. For the third caſe, it's common to the holieſt among Believers, to ſuch as are moſt exerciſed, and moſt ſucceſsful in Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification. It is the ſecond caſe then that is doubtful, there is ſome oppoſition made to ſin (ſo that this caſe differs from the firſt) but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſucceſs: yet are they ſervants to ſin (and ſo this caſe differs from the third): the Mind is not only bowed down, oppreſſed and captivated, but a man is carried to the outward actings of ſin, and the fulfilling the luſts of the fleſh, or the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of the <hi>body of ſin.</hi> Now this is the caſe that many poor ſouls complain of: And 1. What ought we to judg of it? How may a poor Soul be helped out of it? will appear in what we ſhall ſpeak to this Caſe.</p>
            <p>For the firſt of theſe: I Anſwer, That in ſome caſes a poor Creature may make uſe of <hi>Pauls</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements, even when the <hi>body of death</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails much more than it did with <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 7: and does not only inwardly <hi>luſt againſt the Spirit,</hi> but the power of it breaketh forth in words, or deeds, as when thou doſt not make way for theſe, nor open a paſſage for them: but ſets thy ſelf to oppoſe firſt the riſing of them in the
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:103420:89"/>heart, and then the out-breaking of them, as <hi>Paul</hi> did. If thy heart ſtrive and gain-ſay, and not only does not regard iniquity, but oppoſes it and proteſts againſt it; And when it's leading thee captive, thou would even then be glad to be reſcued from it, and can bleſs the Lord as <hi>David</hi> did <hi>Abigail,</hi> when thou art kept back from ſin; his heart relented: whereas <hi>Saul</hi> commands to kill the Lords Prieſts; his ſervants refuſe; but there's no back-going, nor heart-ſmiting in <hi>Saul;</hi> he finds no fault with himſelf; and ſometimes ſuch as he are glad of provocations, and tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to ſin. <hi>Judas</hi> offers himſelf to betray Chriſt, and the High-prieſts are glad: but where there is any thing of true Mortification, the heart is afraid of a temptation, and trembles at the thoughts of it, though perhaps it may be carried away with it; but the renewed Will never conſents; hence the Believer has little plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in ſin, in the acting of it; but when he is ſinning, he is ſighing, and ſuffering, and much more does he ſigh and ſuffer, when after ſinning he is come to himſelf: he feels what <hi>Paul</hi> felt when he cryed out, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.24: and is led to prize and make uſe of Chriſt as he was, <hi>ver.</hi> 25, to ſee the need of his blood to make an Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and alſo take away the blot of ſin; when ſin is prevailing, Grace is often ſaying, O that it were otherwiſe! O captive that I am! this ſate forer to <hi>Paul</hi> than all the croſſes he ever met with; all his ſufferings never occaſioned ſuch a Complaint; and if Faith in Chriſt be not kept up, this is enough to ſink the Soul into deſpair.</p>
            <p>If any ſay, That this does not anſwer the caſe,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:103420:89"/>becauſe ſuch as never mortified one ſin, may yet make oppoſition to many ſins: as that place, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.19, imports; where it's clear, that ſuch as may ſome way oppoſe ſin, may yet be ſo far o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome, as to periſh in it. I Anſwer: That in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed every oppoſition will not prove that there is the leaſt degree of Mortification. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon principles of Nature may ingage a man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſome ſins; Morality and Education may further this; the common operations of the Spirit may heighten this oppoſition, and alſo extend it to more ſins. The Queſtion then is, How ſhall I know whether my oppoſition to ſin, be from a common or ſaving-work of the Spirit? And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, the knowledg of the difference is of great and univerſal uſe; for upon the one hand, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral men finding ſome conflict in themſelves, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend there is ſome grace in the oppoſing ſin: There's none (ſay they) but have Corruption in them, and hereupon pleaſe themſelves, if they find any thing in themſelves, like oppoſition to it. On the other hand, the Believer is in doubt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his oppoſition to ſin be ſuch as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeak of, and his doubt is encreaſed when he perceives his Conſcience upon natural grounds and common reaſons oppoſing ſin; not conſidering that the Spirit in mortifying ſin, may make uſe of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe and reaſon, as well as gracious or ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Conſiderations: for the ſupernatural op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to ſin, does not deſtroy the natural; as Reaſons averſion to what is contrary to Nature, does not deſtroy the Averſion in our ſenſes to it.</p>
            <p>I anſwer then to the Queſtion, That the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:103420:90"/>operations of the Spirit, does not change the inward principles, and motives, and ends that men in Nature act from, and by. 1. Then, the difference appears in this, that the inward oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition that Natural men make to ſin, proceeds from ſome common, low, ſelfiſh principle. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or Education may have imprinted ſome faint Notions of the ill of ſin: but there is no antipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy nor contrariety of Nature to ſin, as in the godly man, who hates ſin as God hates it. One wicked man may hate and oppoſe another: but there's no rooted contrariety in their Nature, as there's between a wicked man and a godly, <hi>Pro.</hi> 29.27; it's in ſound only, one ſin ſtriving againſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; refined ſins oppoſe groſs ſins, or the ſame luſt ſeeking itſelf divers ways: as <hi>Herod</hi> was ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful, becauſe he was in a ſtrait; and whatever he did, was a diſhonour.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Natural man, his motives be alſo mean and mercenary: It is not love to Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, nor a deſire to pleaſe God; it is not the contrariety of ſuch or ſuch a ſin to the holineſs of God, or to the holy Law of God, or the injuriouſneſs of ſin to the love of God, or Chriſt, or the inconſiſtency of it with Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with the Father, Son and Spirit, that ſets him on work againſt ſin: Were there no ſtrange puniſhments here to the workers of Iniquity, and no Hell hereafter, the Natural man would inlarge himſelf in many things: It would be a Jubilee to him, to hear there were no Hell; ſome ſins are againſt a mans intereſt and honour, and no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der there be much oppoſition to them. <hi>Herod</hi> beheads <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> with reluctancy; but whence
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:103420:90"/>came it? not becauſe it was againſt the honour of God: but partly, becauſe to murther an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent man, was a torment to his Conſcience. A natural Conſcience never oppoſes ſin, in favour of the ſpiritual Law of God; for the <hi>carnal mind is enmity</hi> in the Abſtract. I grant, that takes in the Will: yet it ſhews that there's no true friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to God, even in the Mind or Conſcience; ſo that nothing the Conſcience ſays, or does, is pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for God; and its arguments and motives are always Carnal, Carnal fears or hopes; or if the object of fear or hope be ſpiritual, yet they are apprehended, and ſo influenced in a Carnal way.</p>
            <p n="3">3. As the unrenewed Man oppoſes no ſin, out of hatred to it as ſin, ſo it's only againſt ſome ſins that his oppoſition is levelled: more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially groſs and ſcandalous ſins, that are infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous or contrary to Moral honeſty, or contrary to his natural diſpoſition. A Natural Conſcience will tremble at Murther conſummated, but not at every degree of it: not at ſecret inward ſins, nor at the firſt motions of ſin; not at Lucritive ſins, and ſuch as a prophane age has made an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, in the vulgar eſteem; eſpecially not at un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief. It's true, a Natural man may be ſenſible of the ſin of his thoughts, and of inward diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, by ſome common illumination of the Spirit, and may be troubled at them, as they diſturb his quiet, or lead to ſomething which he abhors. But 1. It is not with every degree of every ſin; if he be convinced and troubled at Unbelief as it excludes him from Heaven, yet it's not at eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry degree of unbelief: Nor 2. Is it for the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:103420:91"/>of theſe motions, but the importunity and tendency of them; and as they evidence him to be yet in nature, and ſo without hope, he looks on them as the diſeaſe of his Nature, and not his ſin. 3. If he be diſpleaſed with the acts and ſtirrings of ſin, yet not with the root of them; If he can reſtrain the acts, he could let the <hi>body of ſin</hi> dwell contentedly in him. But it's far o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe with the godly; for as ſin oppoſes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very gracious act, ſo Grace oppoſes every known ſin: yea, and does ſecretly (though not ſo ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly) reſiſt every ſin, whether known to us to be ſuch, or not; Grace in the heart feels that to be ſin, and contrary to its nature, which know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg in the head does not diſcern to be ſin (the Law written in the Heart, goes farther than what's in the Head): as eating of what one has antipathy againſt, will cauſe trouble, though the man knows not of it; but more, if he does.</p>
            <p n="4">4. As the Natural man is not uniform in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing all ſins, ſo he is not even as to all times, he ſeldom or never purſues ſin, but when God or his Conſcience are purſuing him; and he is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo eager in his oppoſition to ſin, but he will admit of a treaty with it, and is eaſily induced to grant a ceſſation of Arms: he is content to hear what can be offered, to reconcile ſuch a thing to the Law of God, and for ſhewing the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtency of it with peace of Conſcience here, and with the hope of glory, at leaſt with his intereſt and honour in this World; the <hi>new man</hi> is deaf to any motion of a parley, and ſtands out to the laſt, and fights upon his knees, and is ſometimes overcome, but never treats nor yields: the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:103420:91"/>man oppoſes ſin as a flowing Tide does a Veſſel going down a River: but ſtraightway the Tide turns, and helps the Veſſel. But the Conflict in the <hi>renewed man,</hi> is like that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween fire and water: there's no yielding nor ceſſation of Arms till the one be overcome; nay, not then. True, the Believer often intermits vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous oppoſition to ſin, and may loſe more ground in an hour, than he can regain in many days: yet Grace never gives over entring its diſſent and proteſtations, nor intermits all oppoſition to ſin, even when its worſted.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The unrenewed man never ſtrives lawfully againſt ſin; he goes forth againſt it in his own ſtrength, not in the name and ſtrength of the Lord, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.45, 46: He ſeeks not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage the Spirits aſſiſtance: he conſiders, or knows little the ſtrength of ſpiritual Adverſaries: and hence is eaſily overcome.</p>
            <p n="6">6. In Natural men, the conflict is between the Conſcience and the depraved Will, or corrupt Paſſions, which is like a foreign War: but in the <hi>renewed,</hi> it's like an Inteſtine War (as one calls it), the renewed Conſcience againſt the unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed; the renewed Will and Affections againſt the unrenewed. There's a Will, and a Will-not, in a Believer: hence the Notion of a double per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.15, 19, 20: there's no ſuch diviſion in others, they may do what Conſcience approves not, but cannot ſay, that they would not; the godly hate the evil they do, and love the good, they do not; whereas the Natural man does hate the good (the ſpirituality of it) he does, and loves the evil which he does not; and may be,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:103420:92"/>dare not do. In Natural men, there's ſome ſparks of light in the Conſcience, but there's no ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied light in it; the Will and Affections are total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly corrupted, ſo that there's nothing in them as a principle to ſet them againſt themſelves: but in the <hi>renewed man,</hi> there's fleſh and ſpirit in every faculty (ſo that the fight is more cloſe): and in every gracious, and in every ſinful work, they both put forth themſelves: and as the fleſh weakens the acts of the Spirit, ſo the oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Spirit makes, weakens the acts of ſin in the Believer (for diviſion weakens): and ſo a Believer never ſins with all his heart, as other men do; the renewed part never gives over all reſiſtance. And it's upon this account, 1. That the ſins of Believers are not ſo great as the ſins of others. It's true, Gods electing Love, Redemption, and Regeneration, lay ſpecial Bonds upon the Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver which highly heightens ſin, and adds many degrees of guiltineſs to it: But if we look to the principle of ſin, and whence it immediately pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds, the unregenerate mans ſin is greateſt, for it is with all his heart, there's not a bit of the man that be-friends Chriſt; there's nothing in ſuch of you that holds with him. As for what oppoſition the Conſcience makes, it is not with your will, if there be any made at all; it's grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous, but no pleaſure to you: ſo that you ſeek out ſhifts and means, either to ſtifle it, or bribe it, or bring it over to be for that which the will and affections are for. Some think the Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ſins are more heinous, becauſe againſt more Light: indeed, this were a good Argument, if the Mind were the only principle of our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:103420:92"/>and not the will, or elective faculty. But let none abuſe this: for truly ſin is ſo dreadful in both, that it's not eaſie to tell in whom its worſe. Hence, 2. We ſee the reaſon why the Believer hath not ſo much pleaſure in Sin as others have, having two parties in him: whatever pleaſes the one, diſpleaſes the other; the <hi>natural man</hi> having but one, is more pleas'd at heart with ſinful ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects: the oppoſition the Conſcience makes, hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders not: but that he deliberately chuſe, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfully act it, and obſtinately perſiſt in it. The Believer is ſometimes taſting of the <hi>forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den fruit,</hi> but Grace marreth the reſult of it: and the more he finds he is pleaſed with it, the worſe he is pleaſed with himſelf.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The Natural mans oppoſition does not any way break the power of Sin, nor does continue till the man get up again; if he fall, he lies ſtill: whereas the Spirit in the Believer, ceaſes not to ſtrive till he be got to his feet again: Sin was painful to him in the going down, but its more bitter in his belly, and he reſteth not till he hath vomited it up again: the Conſcience will ceaſe to ſtrive, but grace never; yea, the godly man often riſes by his falling; he grows more humble, and watchful, and dependent: the grief which ſin breeds, conſumes the Sin that bred it. Whereas the <hi>natural man,</hi> when he overcomes, he is overcome; he grows proud and conceited; the ſeeming mortification of one Sin, does vivifie, or give life and ſtrength to another.</p>
            <p n="8">8. The Natural mans oppoſition tends only to reſtrain or keep in Sin, not to mortifie it: if Sin will be quiet and peaceable, he can let it live;
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:103420:93"/>the Believer ſeeks the death of it, the extirpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and abolition of it. If you ask, how we ſhall know when a Sin is mortified, and when re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained only? or what's the difference between reſtraining and mortifying a Corruption? <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer</hi> 1. When any Corruption is mortified, one is thereby advantaged againſt all other Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: for the killing of one member, or any branch of Original Sin, does weaken the whole; whereas the reſtraining of any Sin does not wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the <hi>body of ſin:</hi> for when it's only reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, what the <hi>body of ſin</hi> loſes one way, it gains another way. Try then, Art thou univerſally advantaged againſt every Sin? 2. Is thy mind, will, and affections, dead to that Sin? <hi>mortifying ſin</hi> is a metaphorical expreſſion; and this death that it implies, is not only nor principally the ceaſing of the acts of Sin, but eſpecially a dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the Soul as to Sin: 1. In the Mind and Judgment, Sin has loſt the mans good opinion of it. 2. In the will and affections, he cannot think nor hear of it without abhorrency; where Sin is only reſtrained, a man can yet with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure roll it in his Mind, the inclination to it is not broken; many a man likes and loves the Sin which he does not; the mortified man hates the evil which he does. 3. Thou mayſt know by what went before, and by what follows: 1. Did thou come eaſily by this power over Sin? It's true, there is often difficulty in reſtraining Sin: but what, means did thou uſe to compaſs this, and overcome the difficulty? Was it by Prayer and Faſting, and after much wreſtling with God, and by the blood of the Lamb, that thou over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came?
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:103420:93"/>Or, was it by other means, or by the meer force of an obſtinate reſolution thou took up? 2. After the mortification of any Sin, there's a <hi>new Song</hi> ordinarily put in the mans mouth: and the Soul is not only ſome way eaſed, but is fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with Joy. There is ſome Joy that flows na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively from the mortification of Sin, and there's more that follows by way of reward: as for a Natural man, if he have any Joy upon reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the acts of Sin, it is but a ſpark of his own kindling: or it reſults meerly from the nature of the thing; the travel and labour the man is at in ſuppreſſing Sin, does more than coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-balance that, and is but the ſcant fruit of the teſtimony of his natural Conſcience; it will not bear him out to challenge Death and the Grave, it heartens not a man againſt them: ſome ſuch may die ſecurely, but never one, I think died triumphantly. Mens deluſions may ſuſpend the horror of Hell from them for a while, when a-dying; but it's ſome true Faith, true Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, true Mortification, that fills the Soul with <hi>joy unſpeakable.</hi> 5. Sins that are only reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, do ordinarily break forth again, and that with more force than before: as waters bound up, that do fortifie themſelves, and then carry all down before them: but a Sin that is mortified, as it rarely recovers; ſo if it do, yet it is ſo broke, that it is but half an act.</p>
            <p>But here may come in two other Caſes: 1. What is to be thought of the caſe of ſuch as relapſe into Sin? 2. What's to be thought of the caſe of ſuch, as after ſome ſerious Eſſays to mortifie, feel their Corruptions more lively than before?</p>
            <pb n="180" facs="tcp:103420:94"/>
            <p>For the firſt, That a godly man may commit an act of that Sin, which is in ſome meaſure mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is paſt all doubt, elſe it were impoſſible he could ſin at all; for the firſt ſanctifying ſaving work of the Spirit does ſtrike at the root of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Sin: and ſo begins the mortification of every Sin; but this doth not nullifie or wholly extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh Sin. No Believer is abſolutely ſecured from any particular act of Sin, <hi>pro hic &amp; nunc,</hi> except from the great Tranſgreſſion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When one is in the ſtate of Grace: as after their particular Repentance for ſome particular Sin he is fallen into; ſo after ſpecial endeavour, yea, and ſucceſs too, in mortifying that Sin, he is not abſolutely ſecured from every act of it for the future: for though a mans Pardon (as it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports a freedom from eternal Condemnation) be perfect, yet neither is Repentance nor Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion perfect. Now to clear this, Let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, 1. The gracious encouragements God hath given to ſuch, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.1. Iſa. 55.7, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare with <hi>ver.</hi> 3. His <hi>Covenant</hi> does not ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure againſt every Relapſe, but it ſecures the multiplication of pardon, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.14, 19, 23. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14.4; <hi>Back-ſliding</hi> ſuppoſes ſome former re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery: Mark there the ground of what's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, <hi>I'le love them freely;</hi> the falling into ſuch Relapſes is the higheſt provocation to God, and a Sin againſt moſt love; and Recovery from ſuch, is the notable effect, and Signal diſcovery of the greatneſs and freeneſs of Gods Love. Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, 2. That the mortification of ſuch a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Sin, gives a man a greater advantage againſt that Sin, and puts at ſome greater diſtance than
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:103420:94"/>from other Sins; yet this advantage againſt this, and diſtance from it, is only gradually, more than againſt or from other Sins, and ſo makes the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of it not ſo probable or eaſie (and if it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, do aggravate it), but not impoſſible, more than the return of any other Sin; eſpecially, when we conſider, that that Sin, which by the firſt ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying work of the Spirit was in a ſpecial man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner oppoſed and mortified, may yet recover. And 3. The advantage that the moſt holy man has over the moſt mortified Corruption, is of the ſame kind: but for degrees, much below the advantage that <hi>Adam</hi> in Innocency had over every Sin, and ſo is not able to ſecure it ſelf; the ſtrongeſt Grace cannot preſerve it ſelf from the moſt mortified Corruption. Hence the Believer muſt <hi>watch and pray,</hi> and depend for aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance againſt it, elſe he ſhould more eaſily fall into it, than <hi>Adam</hi> did into ſin. It's true, there are Promiſes aſcertaining the Believers preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the dominion of Sin, and his final Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt over Sin: (whereas <hi>Adam in Innocency</hi> had no promiſe of the like nature) but there is no word (I know of) in the Bible, that aſcertains the Believers preſervation from every act of that Corruption, which <hi>through the Spirit</hi> he has par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly mortified.</p>
            <p n="4">4. There wants not Examples of the Saints relapſing into Sins: as <hi>Sampſon,</hi> Judg. 16.1, 4; <hi>Abrahams</hi> twice denying his Wife; the Diſciples twice contending for Supremacy; <hi>Jehoſhaphats</hi> inſtance is remarkable, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 18.1, 2, 31, 32, &amp; 19.2: yet <hi>ch.</hi> 20. <hi>v.</hi> 35, he Relapſes. Not to inſtance ſeveral things related of <hi>Peter.</hi> Theſe
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:103420:95"/>Examples, though they do not anſwer in every circumſtance to the caſe propoſed: yet by plain conſequence they confirm our Poſition. For if a Believer may act contrarily to that grace which is ſtrongeſt in him, and may be overtaken with that Sin, or an act of that Corruption which is weakeſt, and that over and over again (as was <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Peter):</hi> then there is no degree of Mortification that ſecures him from repeating an act of that luſt that is mortified. If any ſay, that though Mortification do it not, yet true Repentance does it? I anſwer, If true Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance does it, it's either from the nature of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, or ſome ſpecial promiſe of Grace made to the Penitent: Not the former: For 1. The nature of Mortification ſhould rather ſecure from it. 2. If true Repentance at firſt Converſion do it not, why ſhould it do ſo afterward? Not the 2d: Let that Promiſe be produced: what ever Promiſe (that I know of) can be produced, will plead as much againſt a Believers falling into any Sin, which at his firſt Converſion he did truly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of.</p>
            <p>But to prevent Abuſes of what's ſaid; Let me admoniſh you, 1. That there are ſome Sins, which <hi>Paul</hi> calls <hi>dead works,</hi> Heb. 6.1; <hi>Peter</hi> calls them <hi>mens old ſins,</hi> viz. which they had lived in before Converſion, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.1, 9: and <hi>the pollution of the world,</hi> 2 Pet. 2.19; in theſe the whole World wallowed before Chriſt's Coming. A Relapſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to theſe he ſpeaks of as dangerous, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.2, 19, 20, 21. Much debate there was about this of old: and many utterly refuſed to re-admit ſuch into their Communion, as in times of Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:103420:95"/>did comply with Idolaters, and returned to Idolatry; which was the chief of theſe old Sins that <hi>Peter</hi> mentions, 1 <hi>Ep.</hi> 4.3. And I doubt not, but in the debate that aroſe thereupon, there were extreams on both hands: thoſe that fell upon the one hand, were many, and by their mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude helped to carry the deciſion of the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion in their favour: and the promiſcuous re-ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſuch, tended to the Corruption of the Church ever after; yet on the other hand, I dare not deny, but a godly man may be intangled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain in ſome act of theſe <hi>old ſins,</hi> through the force of ſome great or ſudden temptation. Yet I muſt add, that it is a rare caſe; the fixed bounds how far, and how often, God doth not determinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet in his Word; I think the Lord does not ordinarily ſuffer his people to fall again and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain into thoſe groſs acts of Sin: though we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay, but they may be overtaken with Paſſion, Pride, inordinate love to the World, which though no leſs ſinful in their own nature, yet in their inward actings are not ſo ſcandalous, nor ſuch occaſions to others to blaſpheme. Nor can we deny but that there may be, and will be ſome luſtings towards the groſs actings of theſe <hi>old ſins:</hi> But the acting over of them, I think rare. A man may fall into ſome other heinous ſin of another nature with more eaſe: for mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a particular luſt does in an eſpecial manner advantage a man againſt the return of that; though it weaken the whole <hi>man of ſin,</hi> yet it weakens that particular luſt in ſpecial. Hence there is often a change of the godly mans greateſt Corruption, and he gets ſome ſpecial advantage
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:103420:96"/>againſt that which ſometime did moſt prevail, and another luſt comes in its room, which ſhews the ſtrength of the <hi>body of ſin:</hi> yet diſproves not the truth of the mortification of the former pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing luſt.</p>
            <p>For the 2d Caſe mentioned, <hi>viz.</hi> of thoſe who after ſome ſerious endeavours to mortifie Sin, find their Corruptions more lively than former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. In anſwer to this Caſe: 1. If Corruptions break forth more than formerly, it's the ſame with the former Caſe: and thy ſafeſt courſe is not to ſtand diſputing thy ſtate before that, but to ſtudy acquaintance with the depths of Sin in thee, and in the humble broken-hearted ſenſe thereof, to fly unto Jeſus Chriſt for pardon and for grace to ſanctifie thy Soul, and to mortifie Sin. If they be only more ſtirring inwardly than before, and ſo ſeem more ſtrong; it is a Caſe commonly incident to ſuch of the people of God, as before their regeneration were careful to walk blameleſly, and were morally educated, and ſuch as were formal in Religion. And 1. This may proceed from the malice of Satan, who when his intereſt in the Soul, was not brangled, made no great noiſe; Now as the Dog is put to the Door, he howls to be in again; ſo he blows the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet to an inſurrection and inteſtine war in the Soul, and if it were poſſible would have poſſeſſion again, or have the Soul back into bondage again; and this the holy Lord ſuffers, to manifeſt the ſtrength of his Grace, and that he may, having brought forth the <hi>ſtrength of indwelling ſin,</hi> have occaſion with more obſervation to diſcomfit them. As ſometimes Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, in policy let ſome diſcontented party break
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:103420:96"/>out, on purpoſe to ruine them more effectually.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It may be, thy inward Corruption is not ſtronger than it was, but ſpiritual light and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious tenderneſs may be growing; the Spirit now may be opening up the depths of thy Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And this the Lord uſually does by degrees, as he dealt with <hi>Ezekiel</hi> in a like caſe, <hi>Chap.</hi> 8.6, 7, 9, 12, 13, 15. (where mark, that they had put a wall between God and them), he is ſhewed greater and greater <hi>Abominations;</hi> ſo the ſecret Chambers of Sin are opened up, and thou ſees that which makes thee tremble, and abhor thy ſelf more than ever: for the firſt ſaving-Convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction does not convince to the utmoſt; the firſt ſaving-light ſhines not into every Corner (or at leaſt not ſo brightly, that the man can dive into all the myſtery of Sin within) but leaves room for after-diſcoveries: ſuch Complaints as <hi>Pauls,</hi> Rom. 7.24, are rather the fruit of growing-diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries of Sin, and growing Mortification, than of the growing power of Sin; Bleſs the Lord for ſuch diſcoveries, for they are neceſſary to the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of Sin.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It may be, thou waſt going about to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh <hi>thine own righteouſneſs;</hi> and the Lord ſees it meet to fright away ſuch thoughts, by ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering Satan to rake up the Dunghil of thy Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions: when thou art aiming at ſuch a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of holineſs, and freedom from Sin, in the ſtrength of thy own endeavours, and with a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret neglect of the <hi>imputed Righteouſneſs of Chriſt;</hi> and when thou will not make uſe of that, till thou haſt overcome ſuch a Corruption, and will not maintain thy Juſtification without ſuch a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:103420:97"/>of Sanctification, and Mortification; I think not ſtrange, if God ſhould let open the ſluce of thy Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, to conſtrain thee to hold by the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt for Juſtification, and alſo on his Spirit for the mortifying of thy Corruptions, and to live by faith in Chriſt, both for Righteouſneſs, and Sanctification or Holineſs; and to ſeek neither of theſe, nor any part of them any other way: for it may be, if thou be not proud of thy Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs (to thy own ſenſe) yet thou may think too much of thy own ſtrength (indeed the one is rarely or never really ſeparated from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: for whereſoever a man thinks he has one of theſe, he ſeeks the other alſo. Hence, there are none erroneous in the point of Free-will and Grace, but they err alſo in the doctrine of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, &amp; <hi>e contra,</hi> Iſa. 45.24,) and lay too much ſtreſs on the ſtrength, at leaſt of the ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of thy purpoſes and endeavours againſt Sin. Theſe can no more ſecure thee againſt Sin, than a ſingle thred can hold a Ship at Anchor in a ſtorm; the Lord will teach thee the neceſſity of this Method in the Text, by the Spirit to mortifie Sin.</p>
            <p>And this leads us to an Anſwer to that great Queſtion; How it comes that the godly are ſo ſtrangely intangled in ſin, after ſo many Promiſes to God, and purpoſes againſt Sin? They decree the death of Sin, but it is not eſtabliſhed: Here the matter lies; they take not in the Spirit's aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, in their promiſes and purpoſes, nor in their endeavours, to anſwer their promiſes: there's ſome tang of ſelf-ſufficiency, that marrs all ſuch vain brags as <hi>Peters</hi> are, Cords that are
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:103420:97"/>eaſily broken: and his opinion of ſelf-ability diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered it ſelf by his ſuppoſition, <hi>Though all men ſhould deny thee;</hi> He might well have ſaid, Lord, I would deny thee, though all men ſhould: But he ſpeaks, as if there were ſome peculiar Ability in him to reſiſt Temptations, and his purpoſe was like <hi>Sampſon</hi>'s <hi>green withs:</hi> ſuch ſuppoſitions are hazardous and ſuſpicious, though uſeful, if managed with humility. It's a great myſterie (ſays one) to purpoſe ſo, as yet to believe we can do nothing: and alſo to believe, that Chriſts ſtrength is as effectual for mortifying ſuch a luſt, as if it were our own. And I add, 3. To en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour as induſtriouſly, as if we could do all alone: and indeed, it's through ignorance or neglect in all theſe that our purpoſes miſcarry; Pride hinders the firſt, Unbelief the ſecond, and Sloth the third. There are other reaſons alſo: therefore let me ask you, 2dly, Do you think that Purpoſes or Promiſes, yea, or Vows, can break the inclination to ſin, of themſelves? or break the curſed union that's between the heart and Sin? They are ordinarily the effects of ſtrong Convictions, which do alway diſingage the heart and affections to ſin: and when theſe are not looſed from Sin, no bonds will be ſtrong enough.</p>
            <p>I have formerly ſhewn you, that Convictions may make a man purpoſe; yea, and pray alſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Sin, when the heart and affections may ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly diſſent and deſire that God ſhould not hear; and if the affections ſeem at any time to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire with an enlightned Judgment againſt Sin, yet they are exceeding mutable and unfixed:
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:103420:98"/>and when they are low, or rather byaſsed the other way, no wonder our purpoſes be ineffectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al. 3. They ſometimes miſcarry by reaſon of ſome ſiniſtrous ends: may be you are aſhamed of your paſſions, or you are affraid your corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhould make ſome eruption, to your diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace and infamy; or you intend to bottom your hopes upon the grave of ſuch a luſt; or you deſign freedom from ſuch an impetuous luſt, rather for your own eaſe and quiet, than out of love to holineſs, or hatred to ſin. And ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve and engage againſt ſin, only to ſhift, and for the time put by a preſent challenge for what is done, without any more of it; or to be an excuſe for letting a good frame of ſpirit go, or at leaſt to eaſe the mind, as if ingaging were performing.</p>
            <p>But it may be ſome have ſuch experience of the treachery of their hearts, that having purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſo often, and yet failed, they think it in vain for them to take up new reſolutions; yea, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving broken their promiſes that they made, to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from ſuch a ſin, they think it better to promiſe no more, and come under no more engagements againſt ſin. <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. It is not Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary to us to bind our ſelves againſt ſin: we are obliged to fortifie our ſelves againſt it, as ſtrongly as we can, and to fortifie our reſolutions, by promiſes to, and Covenants with God, againſt ſin. And ſure ſuch as do not ſo, are more eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prevailed againſt, and are ſooner intangled: If many Cords bind you not, the one of a ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple reſolution will not; but may be two or three will, when one will not. If you purpoſe to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:103420:98"/>ſin, be ſincere: why will you not corrobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate it? but here appears the treachery of our hearts; we will certainly ſin, think we. And ſince it muſt be, we indeavour that it be as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle trouble to us as may be, that our ſin may want thoſe aggravations which make it biting and ſtinging to our Conſciences.</p>
            <p>Finally, I doubt the Lord letteth the man fall that will not engage, becauſe his refuſal ſaith as much, as he truſted not God for his aſſiſtance to perform or keep his engagements.</p>
            <p>But is not ſin after ſpecial engagements againſt it, more heinous than if there had been none? <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. He is more acceſſary to his own ſin, in not uſing all Gods ways for preventing it; and he ſins more unexcuſably in omitting that which was in his power to do; as on the other hand, the man that performs his engagements to God, is more acceptable to him than he that ſimply forbears ſin, inaſmuch as it manifeſts a greater abhorrence of ſin, and manifeſts a regard to a double Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, <hi>viz.</hi> of abſtinence from ſuch a ſin, and of keeping our promiſe or vow to God; the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple forbearance of ſin is a compliance with a ſingle Command, and doth not manifeſt ſo much of the mans averſion to ſin.</p>
            <p>If any ask then, how ſhall we purpoſe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage againſt ſin, ſo as we may be diſintangled of it, and effectually get it mortified? <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Be ſure you be ſincere in them. 2. Be ſure your affections concur with your judgment, elſe they will intangle you yet. 3. See that you be alſo deliberate, and that your reſolutions and engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments againſt ſuch a luſt be not only from the
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:103420:99"/>preſent heat of affections. 4. Strive to keep ſuch a frame as you had when you engaged that awe of God, and that hatred of ſin you then had; and be often thinking on your engagements, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling your ſelves for the leaſt breaches of them, 5. Take in the Spirit's aſſiſtance in your purpoſes and endeavours. 6. If one engagement bind not ſtrongly enough, we muſt renew and multiply them. If one knot hold not (ſays one) we muſt caſt more, that we may never want ſome bond over our head. And whereas our breaches aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate our ſin, we muſt bring the aggravations, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the reſt of our ſins, to Jeſus Chriſt, for pardon, and maintain our peace (ſays he) rather by repeated acts of Faith and Repentance, and by often waſhing our ſelves from the filth of theſe ſins, than by pleading no breach at all; and ſee that you ſuffer not the guilt of the ſmalleſt breach to lye for any while unrepented of, leſt it make way for more and greater breaches. Thus you ſee how a poor creature may keep up his hope of eternal life, and aſſurance of intereſt in God, when he is under convictions of many breaches with God, and great ſhort-coming in mortification.</p>
            <p>I add another Conſideration to this: know that our engagements againſt ſin, do not tye us to be altogether without ſin: (though the holy law of God doth) ſuch purpoſes and engagements were fooliſh and impoſſible; but they oblige us honeſtly and ſincerely to wreſtle with, and oppoſe ſin: we cannot oblige our ſelves to overcome it, but to uſe the means which are in our power a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it; and to leave nothing uneſſayed, that
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:103420:99"/>we think to help will mortifie it. And therefore a believer may plead, he has not broke his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements, notwithſtanding many infirmities, and many ſtirrings of a Corruption; yea, even when there is ſome viſible out-breaking of it, ſeeing we do not, nor cannot abſolutely oblige our ſelves as to the event: he may even in this caſe ſay, (in an Evangelick ſenſe) that he has not broken with God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 44.17. his Conſcience bearing him witneſs, that he dealt not falſly with him. And that he bound himſelf to nothing, but what he intended to perform, and what he had actually endeavoured in ſome meaſure to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form; and when he is overcome by ſin, he yields not, conſents not, approves not, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights not in it; But diſſents, proteſts, and crys out, as a chaſt woman when forced, and is made more watchful, and more fearful to be overta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken again, every time he gets up; and knowing the treachery of his heart, dreads it: as one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering from a dangerous diſeaſe dreads the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of it, when he had rather dye than return again to it: when his heart bleeds for the abuſe of Gods Grace. In this caſe thou mayeſt main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain thy peace, and there's ground of hope, that Grace ſhall in the end be victorious over thee. I ſpeak to ſuch as are ready to diſpond (if o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers will needs abuſe it, upon their peril be it) Shall I ſin and break with God, and repent and engage a-new? and again break, and again en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage? ſhall I defile my ſelf, and waſh? and again defile and waſh? If this be not to caſt my ſelf out of Covenant with God, and abuſe his grace, what is it? can this conſiſt with begun-mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation?
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:103420:100"/>But knoweſt thou not, that every ſin againſt God, yea againſt thy Covenant with God, does not diſſolve the Covenant? <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.1, 4, 12, 13, 14, 19, 23. See 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.1, 2. It anſwers thy caſe fully: his mercy is not narrower than ours, which ſhould extend beyond ſeventy-ſeven times; he heals backſlidings more than ſo many times.</p>
            <p>The laſt Caſe I ſhall ſpeak to, is that of ſuch as are in doubt about their condition, becauſe they find not mortification growing, but the ſtrength of ſin is much the ſame it was long ago. <hi>Anſw.</hi> Some are ſinfully curious in enquiring after the meaſure of their progreſs in holineſs and mortification, that they may glory in it; but for a man to ſearch out his own glory, is not glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <hi>Prov.</hi> 25.27. And ſometimes to prevent this, the Lord hides the advantages they have over ſin, from ſome of his people; he draws a vail over their graces and attainments, and diſcovers the ſtrength of their ſin, that he may neceſſitate them to make more uſe of Chriſt, both for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and ſanctification. And indeed, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the uſual chance of war, there are ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny turns and viciſſitudes in the ſucceſs that ſin and grace have againſt each other, that one can hardly judg of the meaſure of his mortification: for he that is victorious one day, yea, one hour, is led captive the next.</p>
            <p>I did formerly give ſome diſcoveries of ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comings in mortification: Now if thou would know thy progreſs in it, 1. How ſtands thy heart affected to the things of the world, that feed ſin within? are they lower in thy eſteem?
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:103420:100"/>the weak Diſciples were contending for preceden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy the night their Maſter was taken from their head; yet after, we find even the Apoſtle born out of time, counting that and all things loſs, &amp;c. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.7. Knoweſt thou better how to part with them? canſt thou diſtinguiſh between complaining of God, and complaining to him for want of them? Angry <hi>Jonas</hi> evidenced little mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. 2. How carry you in reference to others, or to the ſociety you are in? Flattery, Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or Envy, (the ordinary diſeaſes of unmor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified ſouls) bewray want of mortification, or great ſhort-coming in it. 3. How carry you in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to temptations, eſpecially when they come in time of duties? does the heart riſe, recoyl? is it frighted at them? or is it eaſily ſet on fire, at leaſt brought to treating-terms. 4. How carrieſt thou in reference to reproofs? a mortified man will bear well with them, whether they be well managed or not. <hi>Aſa</hi> bewrayed much want of mortification; it argues ſtrong corruption when a reproof wakens it, and occaſions more ſin.</p>
            <p>But take ſome marks of further proficiency in mortification, 1. Haſt thou a fixed reſolution to ſeek thy hearts eaſe, reſt, and ſatisfaction in God alone, and that in the heavieſt and moſt calamitous time? <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.18. Is thy expectation purely from him? and if thou haſt a competence, or may be, abundance of the good things of this world, yet are all thy ſprings in him? and when thou wanteſt, canſt thou take Gods bill of exchange, and believe that all will be anſwered either here, or in the land where holineſs and glory dwell?
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:103420:101"/>2. Doſt thou put thy mouth in the duſt, when under Gods rod? doſt thou adore the wiſdom of God, in chuſing ſuch a rod for thee? does pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate afflictions melt thee, or break thee? Impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience argues a great degree of Impenitency, and unmortifiedneſs. If the livelineſs of ſin be thy grief, thou wilt be content that he ſhould rid thee of it, and make thee partaker of his holineſs, any way he will; canſt thou ſubmit to deſertions, I mean, ſo as to keep up thy love to God, and thy purpoſe to call on him night and day, and in the morning to prevent him with thy prayer? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 88. &amp; 22.1, 2. Can you wait the Lords time? can you after the greateſt earneſtneſs in prayer, make a reference to his good pleaſure? does the caſe of the Church of God afflict thee more than thy private caſe? or canſt thou not ſit down quiet with thy perſonal accommodations, when thy conſcience tells thee that thou art ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the common calamities of others, as <hi>David?</hi> 3. Canſt thou retrench thy ſelf in what God allows thee, when the uſing of thy liberty is like to be a ſtumbling to the weak? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 4. Are ſpiritual pollutions as loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to thee, as bodily ſins? or rather, is thy grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt care to keep thy heart pure. O, but thoſe who cannot overcome the bordering-Towns or Caſtles of a Land, are ſar from overcoming the whole Land.</p>
            <p>I ſhall ſhut up all with ſome uſes that we ſhould make of theſe remainders of ſin in us; which by our utmoſt diligence we cannot fully mortifie. 1. When thou obſerves the ſtrength, even of the broken forces of ſin, which thou would
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:103420:101"/>earneſtly expel, and yet art not able; thou muſt needs ſee cauſe to aſcribe the begun deſtruction of ſin, and conqueſt over it, not to thy own ability or free-will, but to the grace of God; and indeed, if every man have ſufficient power to caſt down ſin from its dominion, and to give it a deadly wound, it is ſtrange that no man ſhould have pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er totally to deſtroy it, or to kill it out-right: for he that may do the greater, may do the leſs. The Hypotheſis of effectual grace, does eaſily ſolve the doubt, and refers the reaſon that ſin is not deſtroyed wholly in every believer, to the good pleaſure of God: but the Hypotheſis of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will and ſufficient-grace will never do it. 2. Let the feeling of the reliques of ſin, further ſelf-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial, and humility, and hide pride from thine eyes, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7. Let them provoke the lively ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed, and train thee up in prayer. <hi>ver</hi> 8, <hi>For this I beſought the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. and in dependance, <hi>ver.</hi> 9, <hi>My grace is ſufficient for thee,</hi> &amp;c. Admire the freeneſs of his grace, and the greatneſs of his power in carrying a poor weak Creature to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, which is more wonderful than the carrying of a ſmall burning Candle through the tempeſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and bluſtering air. 3. See the uglineſs and the treachery of the old man, and the miſery that Chriſt came to deliver from. If you credit not what the word ſays of it, ſee it in your ſelves: ſee the enmity that is in your nature to God. If you ſee not evil enough in one luſt, look on more: had you only ſeen this at your firſt Converſion, you might have forgot the ſin and miiſery the Lord has delivered you from. 4. Let this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke compaſſion to ſuch as are in bondage to ſin;
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:103420:102"/>and meekneſs to ſuch as through weakneſs fall and are intangled with ſin, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.1. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.2.5. Let this confirm you alſo in the doctrine of Juſtification by free-grace: all natural men go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to eſtabliſh their own righteouſneſs; and in the renewed man there's <hi>often ſome</hi> Inclination to it, and ſome neglect of Chriſts righteouſneſs (this inclination may riſe when other luſts are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt buried. It troubled Mr. <hi>Knox</hi> when he was near to die, yet was quickly overcome) even when we have moſt need of it: And hence our confidence grows, as inherent righteouſneſs grows. O, what then would we have done, were there no ſin in us, nothing to neceſſitate us to flie to Chriſts righteouſneſs; if as it is, there's ſome inclination, either to ſet up our own alone, or in conjunction with Chriſt's! The Lord will have his people looking both on their Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and ſanctification every day, as new gifts; and that ſong to be daily in our mouths, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.1, 3. Laſtly, Be longing for the coming of Chriſt, and for thy full redemption; welcome him for this final deliverance from ſin: Let this commend heaven to you, and make it heaven in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.</p>

Some ſay, That God indued the Serpent with Reaſon and Speech for that ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; but that is no ſmall reflection on God; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, being uſed by Satan as the Inſtrument, it is involved in the Curſe, and is become hateful to man: there is an enmity between man and it; and the ſight of it, ought to quicken our enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty againſt Satan: yet every one of them have nor their head bruiſed, and but very few of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind have their heel bruiſed by that Creature: ſo that we muſt not underſtand it literally. By the Woman, is not meant <hi>Evah</hi> only, or one indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual; hence, ſome infer that there's a bitterer enmity between Satan and the Woman, than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and men, that Sex being the weakeſt and moſt ſubject to fears and ſuſpitions, and ſo the apter to conceive hatred. By <hi>the ſeed of the woman</hi> is to be underſtood, 1, and eſpecially, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, in the ſame ſenſe, that he is called <hi>the ſeed of Abraham,</hi> of <hi>David.</hi> Sometimes <hi>ſeed</hi> is taken collectively for a Multitude; ſometimes for a ſingle or particular perſon, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.16, <hi>To Abraham and his ſeed were the promiſes, made:
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:103420:103"/>he ſaith not, and to ſeeds, as of many: but of one, and to thy ſeed, which is Chriſt.</hi> It was Chriſt then that was mainly meant by <hi>ſeed,</hi> in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gen. 12.1, 2, 3, &amp; 18.18. &amp; 22.18: which places are explicatory of this <hi>ſeed</hi> in the Text, and a confinement of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to the Family of <hi>Abraham.</hi> Here he is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>the ſeed of the woman:</hi> It's like with ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to his taking fleſh only of a woman, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 7.14. Yet here, 2. We muſt alſo take in Chriſt's ſelect Seed, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.13, compare with <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.20. For they are parties in this quarrel and enmity: they have their <hi>heel bruiſed,</hi> and they <hi>bruiſe Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans head,</hi> Rom. 16.20. And ſeeing all that's here ſaid of the <hi>womans ſeed,</hi> agreeth to all the Elect: why ſhould we not think them included in this ſeed? yet in a different ſenſe, the enmity and victory are perfect in Chriſt, not in us. It's remarkable, that when the Promiſe is made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>ſeed,</hi> the <hi>believing Parents</hi> are inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; hence <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.17, <hi>I will multiply thy ſeed: Heb.</hi> 6.14, <hi>I will bleſs thee, and multiply thee:</hi> even ſo when the promiſe is made to the <hi>believing Parent,</hi> the <hi>believing ſeed</hi> are included. Hence <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.3, <hi>In thee ſhall all the families of the earth be bleſſed,</hi> Acts 3.25; the Apoſtle expounds it, <hi>In thy ſeed ſhall all the kindreds of the earth be bleſſed:</hi> the enmity then is not only between Chriſt perſonal and the Devil, but alſo between Chriſt myſtical, &amp;c. And the victory over Satan is promiſed, not only to Chriſt perſonally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, but to Believers who are his ſeed: yet in a ſecondary ſenſe only, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.20.</p>
            <p>By the <hi>Serpents ſeed,</hi> are meant the Reprobate
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:103420:104"/>World: for ſo they are called, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.7. <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.33, <hi>Generation of vipers. John</hi> 8.44, <hi>Ye are of your father the devil.</hi> Acts 13.10, <hi>Child of the devil.</hi> 1. Joh. 3.8, <hi>He that committeth ſin is of the devil;</hi> and to them agree what is ſpoke of the Serpents ſeed, <hi>viz.</hi> their enmity and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the godly, as far as in them lyeth.</p>
            <p>By the Serpents head, is meant his craft and power, his cunning: he had contrived mans ruin, this policy and power is to be bruiſed or cruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: the word is uſed only here, and <hi>Job</hi> 9.17, <hi>He breaketh me with a tempeſt:</hi> this is expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.31. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.14, 15. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.8. <hi>heel,</hi> or footſtool, a figurative expreſſion; alſo inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating the ineffectualneſs of Satans attempts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Chriſt and his ſeed: he may wound them, but not mortally; he had a hand in bringing Chriſt to the Croſs, thereby he wounded <hi>his heel,</hi> his Humane nature, but that brought him under Chriſts feet: ſome think it, <hi>(Muſculus)</hi> not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to attribute <hi>bruiſing</hi> to Satan, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore render <hi>Conouliel, he ſhall ſmite his heel. Tunius</hi> thinks there is nothing here attributed to Satan, as if he could hurt Chriſt or his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: but that the word imports only Satans cunning and indirect attempts, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 49.17; and that when he is juſt about to bite, Chriſt ſhall tread upon him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 25.8. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.53, 57. Some think the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> has an eye to this Promiſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49.6, 26.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We have in the words the manner of our Deliverance pointed out, 1. Whence it has its riſe; from infinite Wiſdom and Mercy, <hi>I will put.</hi> 2. How will he do it? Hee'l break that
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:103420:104"/>league and friendſhip that ſin had made between Man and the Devil; from this their ſin and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery had it's riſe. Now this does import the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of Man to favour with God, and to the Image of God; for while man abides in ſin, this friendſhip laſts, <hi>John</hi> 8.44, <hi>His work he does.</hi> But what ſhall be the event and iſſue of this En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity and War? I Anſwer, This <hi>ſeed of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> ſhall conquer Satan, and deſtroy his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; but firſt he muſt ſuffer by Satans means, and have his <hi>heel bruiſed.</hi> In the latter part of the words, the ſingular number is uſed, <hi>he</hi> and <hi>they,</hi> rather than <hi>thy ſeed;</hi> becauſe Chriſt was to vanquiſh the <hi>old Serpent,</hi> who ſeduced our firſt Parents: and he being deſtroyed, his ſeed periſh with him, <hi>John</hi> 12.31. &amp; 14.30. Now it's ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable, that though firſt the <hi>womans ſeed</hi> is mentioned, which meaneth all the godly which were to come of her: yet the Pronoun <hi>it,</hi> or <hi>he,</hi> as it's in the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> does plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note ſome ſingle perſon, <hi>viz. Chriſt;</hi> the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Edition has it, <hi>ipſa,</hi> as if it reſpected the Woman, not her Seed, or any one to come of her.</p>
            <p>This was the firſt, and for ought we know, the only Declaration of Gods Purpoſe about our Redemption made to our firſt Parents: This was all that the faith of the people of God had for ſome Ages to live upon; and this was the ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of all the Religion of ſucceeding Ages, and to which all the Sacrifices from the beginning had reſpect.</p>
            <p>There be ſome that would hence infer, the <hi>Covenant of Grace</hi> to be as large as the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:103420:105"/>of works,</hi> and the one to be made with all mankind as well as the other; and that all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind had ſome Revelation of Chriſt in their firſt Parents: and thus they think to weaken that Argument againſt univerſal Redemption, taken from the non-revelation of Chriſt to moſt of mankind, ſeeing we connot ſuppoſe God to have really intended the ſalvation of all by Chriſt; and not have given all a ſufficient Revelation of him.</p>
            <p>But 1. <hi>Adam</hi> is never ſpoke of in Scripture as a publick perſon in reſpect of the <hi>ſecond Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> as he is in reſpect of the <hi>firſt,</hi> Rom. 5.15, 16, 17, 18; had <hi>Adam</hi> been guilty of Unbelief, and ſo have forfeited the benefit of the <hi>ſecond Covenant,</hi> that had not prejudged his poſterity of the good of it. Now it is certain, that this Revelation of Jeſus Chriſt was in a few Ages ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly loſt; and no wonder, conſidering the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity of it, and mans proneneſs to corrupt all divine Revelations and Inſtitutions. Indeed, all the Superſtition and Idolatry which the Apoſtate world fell into, was founded on an Opinion, That there was ſome way for attaining to the favour of God; but what that way was, they were in a few Ages as ignorant, as if there never had been any ſuch Revelation: and the knowledg of it not being tranſmitted to Poſterity, or there being no Revelation made of it to them, by no Law were they bound to know it, and ſo ſhall be judged only by the <hi>Covenant of works.</hi> And for the Heathens Notion of a poſſible way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering the favour of God; whatever it was founded on for ſome Ages at firſt, it does now, and did partly then, proceed from the miſtakes
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:103420:105"/>and carnal apprehenſions of God, and then igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of their exceeding ſinfulneſs; for we ſee that when <hi>Adam</hi> has any freſh and lively ſenſe of it, he runs away from God, Indeed, it is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural to apprehend a Natural love in God (which <hi>Arminians</hi> call <hi>Antecedent love</hi>) ſtrongly inclining him to the ſalvation of all: which deſtroys Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, and is as unſuitable to the nature of God, as the Jewiſh Fables of Gods afflicting himſelf in a ſecret place for the burning of the Temple, and for their Captivity: And that for theſe he ſmites his breaſt, and pours two tears into the Ocean every day; ſo the Heathens made <hi>Jupiter</hi> to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the Deſtinies which he could not mend; and the <hi>Alcoran</hi> makes God wiſh well to <hi>Mahomet,</hi> but cannot free him from death.</p>
            <p>But to conclude this; Gods diſcriminating love is plain from this firſt promiſe: there's the <hi>ſeed of the Woman,</hi> and <hi>the ſeed</hi> of the <hi>Serpent.</hi> The <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah</hi> is not promiſed to all: Chriſt the ſeed of the Woman, is not promiſed to the ſeed of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, nor ſuffers for that ſeed; Jeſus Chriſt broke the <hi>Serpents head,</hi> and deſtroyed Satan as a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick perſon for the whole elect Seed, but not in the room and ſtead of the ſeed of the Serpent: yea, you ſee that in the very firſt promiſe of Chriſt, there are ſome excluded, <hi>viz.</hi> all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate, called <hi>the Serpents ſeed:</hi> their enmity is foretold as ſoon as Chriſt is promiſed, and their ruin is foretold as ſoon as the ſalvation of the elect Seed; and indeed if we obſerve the words, and conſider the Context, they are as much threatning to the one, as they are a promiſe to the other.</p>
            <pb n="204" facs="tcp:103420:106"/>
            <p>The Text affords great variety of weighty mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: I ſhall only touch upon it, and give ſome truths from the words. We ſee that there is an eſtabliſhed enmity, and irreconcilable feud be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Satan and his followers on the one ſide, and Chriſt and his followers on the other: Satan gets power to vex and trouble the Church of God, and to leave ſome marks of his malice upon them, both in their inward and outward condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but Chriſt with his followers ſhall at length utterly overthrow and cruſh him. And O, what a ſweet Scripture is this, and how much to be ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died! here's the Marrow of the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament,</hi> and the firſt out-breaking of Gods Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Council, and glorious Contrivance about fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len Man!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 1. That God did not leave all Mankind to periſh in their Apoſtacy from him and in their contracted friendſhip with Satan — The ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Sinners was now as near to an Impoſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as could be; Satan knew the threatning, and concluded, That if he could entice man to ſin, he had ruin'd and involved him in as remedileſs Wrath, as himſelf was under: he knew man could not, and ſuppoſed God would not interpoſe; or if he would, he could not die, nor ſuffer; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt muſt be Man and God both, that he may ſuffer and triumph alſo. Satan was at his firſt fall curſed; he is again for his acceſſion to mans ſin curſed, and the Beaſt that was but the Inſtrument, is curſed, <hi>ver.</hi> 14, The <hi>earth is curſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for his ſake;</hi> ver. 17, yet himſelf is not curſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And here appears the kindneſs and love of God our Saviour; (he will not have us looking only
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:103420:106"/>to the kindneſs of Chriſt our Saviour, but chiefly to the Fountain-love of God), <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.3, 4, 5. Here is opened up the Sealed-fountain of his heart, which no ſin could dry up: Man is now wholly at Free-graces courteſie, and yet unmeet for mercy: but Mercy unasked, and no doubt unexpected, ſteps out, when they had no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence to ask it. It was in contemplation of this <hi>promiſed ſeed,</hi> that they were fot a moment reprieved, that the ſentence of Death did not immediately after they had ſinned, take place, and this was all they had to quiet their fearful Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences with. The <hi>womans ſeed</hi> dieth (which upon the account of the lowneſs of his Humane nature, and his overcoming of Death, is called <hi>but the bruiſing of his heel</hi>) and <hi>bruiſeth the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents head,</hi> which carries in it the deſtruction of Death, for thereby he <hi>deſtroyed him that had the power of death;</hi> ſee <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 2. That albeit this be not a perſonal ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction made by the guilty man, yet it is a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal ſatisfaction according to Gods own Law — By which the near kinſman was to redeem the laſt Inheritance: he is our near kinſman, <hi>Job</hi> 19.25. <hi>Heb. My kinſmen, the ſeed of the woman.</hi> God did not alter the <hi>firſt Covenant</hi> or Law, nor the Sanction of it, for Unbelievers are yet under it, <hi>John</hi> 13.36. Some ſay, there was here a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxation of the Law in the Tranſlation of the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment to another: Indeed, all poſitive Laws are relaxable, and the admitting of this, infers no change in God: for he can abrogate Laws, which is more (as he has done the Ceremonial), ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing he had not declared he would not do it,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:103420:107"/>and this without any change in himſelf. Some ſay, that in reference to the Elect, the Obligation to <hi>death</hi> firſt and ſecond, was declared <hi>null</hi> by the Promiſe in the Text; but neither is this true: for before they are in Chriſt, they are obnoxious to it, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.3. Some chuſe rather to call it a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of the meaning of the threatning, which in Gods intention and purpoſe was purely le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal, <hi>viz.</hi> in reſpect of the Reprobate, that they ſhould actually and eventually die the <hi>firſt and ſecond death,</hi> except that God intended in many to ſuſpend the preſent execution of it, and that upon Chriſts account alſo, and that it was in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the Elect partly Evangelick, <hi>In the day thou eatest,</hi> thou or thy Kinſman; or, thou and all thy Children, <hi>ſhall die the firſt and ſecond death;</hi> or elſe I muſt ſubſtitute one in thy room. It's true, <hi>Adam</hi> was not to believe this exception, till it was revealed; nor was he bound to believe that God would not provide a Remedy; he was not obliged to deſpair between his fall and the promiſe in the Text, but to believe that God was able to ſave him, and to rely upon that accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the law of Nature; for the Threatning did only ſhew what God might juſtly do, not what he abſolutely would do; ſo <hi>Adam</hi> was not abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to believe that he ſhould die, nor yet that he ſhould not die, as the Serpent would have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. If any ſay, May not Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners hope that all his Threatnings againſt them, in reference to this life, and that which is to come, may admit of Tacit Conditions? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, Goſpel-Threatnings are not only declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of what ſin deſerves, but alſo of what ſhall
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:103420:107"/>be the event: they are not ſimple Threatnings, but certain predictions; or they are ſuch Threatnings as are confirmed by an Oath, and ſo declared to be irrevocable: and this may alſo obviate a doubt which ſome may have about the Promiſes; Why may not the Lord relax them, or have ſome ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Condition (that I know not of) in his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, as he had in this firſt Threatning? for in the Promiſes, we have all the evidences that can be of the certainty of them as to the event. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, there's a great odds between Promiſes and Threatnings in this reſpect, that Promiſes give to the party a right to the thing promiſed, and he cannot be looſed without the parties conſent; a meer Threatning does only declare the deſert of ſin in the perſon ſinning: yet when confirmed by an Oath, as <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.3, or <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.11, 18, <hi>And to whom ſware he, that they ſhould not enter into his Reſt, but to them that believe not?</hi> or, has any other Declaration of Gods purpoſe annexed to it as irrevocable as his Promiſes. We might hence draw many uſeful inferences.</p>
            <p>Hence, what ſupport to our Faith! and what an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to make to the Law! our kinſman was <hi>bruiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> &amp;c. We may learn with what boldneſs all <hi>the ſeed of the woman</hi> may now come to Chriſt, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome way in kin to Chriſt; he was the Churches comfort in all their ſtraits of old, in caſe of ſin, as in the Text: and in caſe of outward diſtreſs, the renewing of the Promiſes was the great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement that God would not deſtroy them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 7.14. <hi>Mic.</hi> 5.5. and ſtill it is ſo to us. Now his Divine Nature is the great ſupport to our faith and comfort; yet his being of our fleſh, is a
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:103420:108"/>great inducement to come to him, and a help to our faith and comfort. Without his Divinity, it will be comfortleſs; but as united to his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, its a rich Mine. May we ſuppoſe you had a Brother in any Court, that were in as much favour with the King, as he is with God, and whom you could acquaint with your caſe, as ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily as you can do to him, would you not be often at Court, and would you not come more freely; at leaſt be often ſending thither? Are the promiſes far off to you? Is pardon, grace, peace, healing, righteouſneſs or ſtrength, far off from you? Why are they ſtrange to you? Why are you ſtrange to Chriſt? Will he hide himſelf from his own fleſh? Rich and poor are equally near to him. May not this help our weakneſs in coming to God? Of old few Sea-faring men ventured on the Ocean, but coaſted along the ſhoar for want of skill: the Godhead is a bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Ocean, you dare not venture on it: here's a ſafe and eaſie ſhore, by which you may come at God without being ſwallowed up. And learn hence to plead your part in him; plead this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to him, till you get a nearer, as the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple plead a general relation to God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64.7, 8. <hi>David</hi> took it well of the men of <hi>Judah,</hi> but Chriſt will take it better: he will not ſcorn thee, as ſome do their poor kindred.</p>
            <p>It was one great end he had in his aſſuming our nature, that he might be a merciful High-Prieſt: the Angels would have made greater High-Prieſts, but they would not have had ſuch bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els as one man has to another, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.1, 2. <hi>Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry High-prieſt taken from among men, is ordained
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:103420:108"/>for men: who can have compaſſion,</hi> &amp;c. So <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.16, 17. (and now he cannot more ceaſe to be merciful, than he can ceaſe to be man, or diſſolve the union of his Natures which ſhall never be); in the <hi>Greek</hi> it is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that he might be made merciful. The expreſſions of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion there uſed, cannot be meerly metaphorical, as often ſuch words are, when attributed to God under the old Teſtament: for the words import ſuch mercy, or rather being merciful, in ſuch a way, as being God alone, could not have been. Indeed God cannot be made more merciful by taking on our nature: But thus he became mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful in a new way, and in a manner more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable to us, even as man. Nothing can be added to the greatneſs of Gods mercy; and there's no mercy in the humane nature, but what it had from the Divine; and had he not had the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the God-head to inlarge his compaſſion to ſinners, his mercy could never have held out: But the aſſumption of the ſeed of the woman, adds a kindlineſs and naturalneſs (as one ſays) to his mercy to us: ſo that what is metaphorically ſpoke of, is liberally true of the Mediator. And though now in heaven he has no afflicting paſſions, nor what imports infirmity and frailty, as he had on the earth; yet for the ſubſtance they are the ſame, and inſtead of that afflicting frailty that was in them, there's now a greater largeneſs and livelineſs of affection, which does as effectually prompt him to relieve us. Sure our High-prieſt laid not aſide his love pity and compaſſion, when be entered within the holy-place. You will ſay, That though he was the ſeed of the woman, yet
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:103420:109"/>not having experience of ſin as I have, What can his humane nature further his compaſſion to me? <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. What makes a gracious ſoul pity them that are fallen, but it's Conformity to Chriſt? <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.1. 2. He felt the guilt of more ſin, and in a livelier manner than ever thou didſt; he knows what deſertion for ſin is, what a wounded heart is, and what the bitterneſs of ſin is. And, 3. He was grieved for the ſin of others, and ſo knows how to compaſſionate thoſe who are grieved for ſin in themſelves. And finally, why may we not ſay, That as when he healed the ſick, he uſed to take their ſickneſs as it were upon himſelf, <hi>Matt.</hi> 8.16, 17. and ſome way to afflict himſelf, <hi>Joh.</hi> 11.38. by ſympathy, though he was never ſick? ſo being to ſatisfie for the elects ſin; when he ſaw any of them ſin, he might be ſaid to be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with it, as if it had been his own; ſome think this the meaning of that obſcure place, <hi>Matt.</hi> 8.16, 17. Let none ſay, What is all this to me? Chriſt is not promiſed to the Serpents ſeed; and what know I but I am one of theſe, I find ſuch enmity to God and Chriſt? and thus I obviated the laſt occaſion. Only now, 1. You may be among the other ſeed, for ought you know, as well as they, and a may-be is much in this caſe. 2. They are not all the ſerpents ſeed, who have of the ſerpents ſeed in them. 3. Is thy enmity thy burthen? Art thou willing to lay it down, and to come over to Chriſts ſide?</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Obſ.</hi> That the recovery of lapſed man is O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginally and ſolely from God; <hi>I will put,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> did not propoſe, nor deviſe this, but was flying and hiding, when this news overtakes him.
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:103420:109"/>
               <hi>Man he was not called to counſel,</hi> Iſa. 40.30. Nor was ſo much as in ſpeaking-terms with God; there's neither Merit, nor Motive, nor Impulſive cauſe in man; his miſery could be no cauſe, for the fallen Angels were no leſs miſerable: and indeed this is a plot worthy of infinite wiſdom, as well as mercy, and which the quickeſt finite underſtandings were ſo far from being able to find out, that when revealed, they cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend it, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 12, but are yet at School, and Learning it: and indeed it had been blaſphemy for Men or Angels to have ſpoke it, before it was revealed. <hi>Jerome</hi> makes <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.1, 2. to be the words of wondering Angels. And no doubt the words of the Text made the Devils ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed.</p>
            <p>The plot it ſelf, the deſignation of Chriſt for this buſineſs, the manner of carrying it on, the ſtability of this promiſe, the choice of the ſeed to whom it's made, was ſolely of him and he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf revealed it: <hi>Adam</hi> was not thinking of it when it was firſt mentioned. God will needs carry the firſt news of it himſelf; had he ſent An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, guilty conſciences might likely have miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted them. It's true, he ſends news of this to us by men gifted of purpoſe for ſuch tydings: But till he himſelf reveal this myſtery to our hearts, it is not underſtood nor revealed, <hi>Matt.</hi> 13.11. &amp; 11.25. And finally, it is his proper work to break the ſinners friendſhip with Satan, and to reconcile them to himſelf: and all that's here promiſed is the effect of his grace.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> See your ſelf ſcored off from all ſharing
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:103420:110"/>in the glory of your own Salvation. Grace, appears in the whole contrivance, and in the Application of it: you may read fallen <hi>Adams</hi> caſe, and your own too, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.3, 4, 5, 6. It's true, that is ſpoke with reſpect to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous extract; but is applicable to every Nation, and to every particular perſon; does that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe in the Text reach you? know, you were in no better, if not a worſe caſe than <hi>Adam,</hi> when it took hold of you. Therefore, 1. Own him in the whole buſineſs of your Salvation, from firſt to laſt, in the revealing of it in the Branches and Contents of it, and in bringing you to cloſe with it, and making you to cleave to it; in breaking your friendſhip with Satan, and bringing you o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to his own ſide. 2. You that are yet on Satans ſide, and are beginning to weary; Imploy him to bring you over to his party: imploy himſelf to reveal this myſtery to you contained in this great promiſe, <hi>Matt.</hi> 13.11. To reveal Chriſt in you, and to reſcue you effectually from Satan; to engage you in this warfare, and to make you ſucceſsful in it.</p>
            <p>But more particularly: Let us conſider this enmity, and war, and the event of it, and that with reſpect to ones inward condition. 2. Or with reſpect to ſin and holineſs, with reſpect to your outward. For the 1ſt, Satan has ſpued ſin, his ſeed, into our firſt Parents, and they have tranſmitted it to all their poſterity. Now thoſe who are begot again by Jeſus Chriſt, they have his ſeed in them: Grace, or the Divine Nature is called the ſeed of God, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.9. Not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſively of Chriſt, this is that which makes us like Chriſt; and to repreſent him as a Child does
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:103420:110"/>the Parent; hence called, Chriſt formed in us; even as ſin makes one reſemble Satan, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.8, and may be called Satans ſeed: ſome ſpeak ignorantly, as if there were the material ſeed of the Devil in men; which may be they fetch from the <hi>Turks Alcoran,</hi> which ſays, that there's a drop of black blood in the middle of every ones heart, which they call the ſeed of the Devil; and which they ſay, the Angels having opened up <hi>Mahomet</hi> when a child, waſhed out of him. Nor is their notion much unlike that of the <hi>Carteſians,</hi> about their <hi>glandula pinealis in Cerebro,</hi> from the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whereof proceeds all inordinate deſires. But, 2. The godly have a party without to conflict with: from the whole obſerve, 1. Some thing ſuppoſed, <hi>viz.</hi> that ſin having entred the world, all men are on Satans ſeed, and in enmity with God, till this promiſe take effect on them. 2. That Satans intereſt is not at once deſtroyed, nor are the elect at once perfectly ſaved: Satan has a party ſtill in the world; yea, he hath ſome part in every man here. None can ſay as Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.30, <hi>The Prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me;</hi> he is at perfect vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with Satan; Satan could get nothing in him to faſten his temptations upon; he has ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and ſome footing in the godly man, his ſeed is not at once purged out, but is ſtill ſtirring and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting, and counteracting Chriſt and his intereſt in the ſoul. It's ſo ordered by the holy Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty of God: Satan begot this enmity, and God in his holy providence ſuffers it to remain in part. Now for the 1ſt, It is ſuppoſed that there's nothing in men, but enmity to Chriſt, and a heart
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:103420:111"/>working againſt him. There was nothing elſe in <hi>Adam</hi> when this promiſe began to take effect on him; and there's nothing elſe now in ſinners when it begins to be fulfilled on them; this is the nature of ſin, and the beſt notion we can have of it, enmity to God, and to Chriſt, and to his Image; It's contrary to him; It's an enemy to his being, and makes the ſinner wiſh God were not, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 14.1. And it's pleaſing to him to think, May be there is none: this enmity in the abſtract is in every natural mans mind, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7, much more in the heart and affections; and all the members of the body are imployed as weapons to fight againſt him. Men hate him not indeed, as Creator or Preſerver, &amp;c. but as Holy and Righteous, as a Lawgiver and Judg; and this is for no wrong on his part, but they have wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, and would be rid of him: this was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt in <hi>Adam.</hi> And O that this notion of ſin were more fixed in our hearts: it muſt be in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very true penitent. In Hell there's no repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, becauſe there's nothing but enmity to God there: in heaven there's none, becauſe there's no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Amity: here there is ſomething of both in the godly; indeed in the natural man there's only enmity. Now, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.12, 13, 14. <hi>Lev.</hi> 26.40, 41, the penitent bewails that he has walked contrary to God: there's nothing at all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friends God in the natural man; he is wholly for Satan; there's no ſpark of pure light within, for the mind and Conſcience are engaged againſt God, and conſpire with Satan, the foundation of whoſe Kingdom is laid in darkneſs: may be the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral man trembles at a ſight of the Devil, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:103420:111"/>in a ſort a creature of another world, and being repreſented as an enemy to Mankind. But is it not apparent how much ſinners conſpire with him, in his enmity and contrariety to God; ſome there be that Covenant with him, ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly, ſome virtually; in many places of the world he is familiarly convers'd with; yea, and worſhipped; and did not evil ſpirits frequently and familiarly haunt houſes in times of Popery, and ſeem'd to do good offices unto them; and were called by the vulgar, <hi>Faries, Brownyes,</hi> by ſome <hi>Familiars, good Neighbours?</hi> and how well affected many are yet to Satan, appears by their application to him, or his inſtruments, in caſe of loſt or ſtoln goods, or the like doubtful caſes: But what a ſecret power and intereſt has he with thouſands where he is not ſo diſcreetly owned? how many do merrily dance when he pipes to them? how many willing, loving ſlaves has he? his power with them is manifeſt, by their acting ſuch prodigious wickedneſs ſometimes, at which even corrupt humane nature in others is made to tremble. Others he deals more gently with, and puts them not on ſuch hard ſervice; they are at peace with him, and for a while he keeps peace with them; they trouble not him, and he troubles not them: he has a claim to them, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by his own requeſt, partly by their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, one way or other, and partly by the Lords holy and righteous giving them up to him, as a juſt puniſhent of mans firſt breaking with him, taking himſelf to Satan. And not only has he a claim to them, but he has poſſeſſion of all out of Chriſt (and one would think that this
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:103420:112"/>were enough to waken ſinners): may be ſome of them at ſome times take up ſome diſlike of their ſtate; but, yet are eaſily reconciled to it again; or make ſome little breach, or fall at ſome odds with the Prince of this world, but ſoon reconcile themſelves again.</p>
            <p>Now when this promiſe comes to take effect on any ſoul, the Lord comes and caſts out Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, and he ſeizes on the ſoul: this is called his apprehending it, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.12. Satan is loth to loſe the ſinner. But Jeſus Chriſt, that is ſtronger than he, caſts him out, and he muſt bring down and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſh ſtrong holds ere this be done, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4, 5, 6. and put forth that power whereby he is able to ſubdue all things to himſelf: Satan pulls, and Chriſts draws, and the Father draws: Satan and the ſinner joyn all their ſtrength to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: he does with ſinners, as the <hi>Turks</hi> do with their Galley-ſlaves, that make them ſerve againſt their friends, and ſuch as would ſet them free: Only here's the difference, theſe do it by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, but ſinners do heartily joyn iſſue with Satan, and reſiſt Chriſt, as if he were about to hurt them. Now at length Satan is caſt out, and the ſinner yields, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30.8. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.12, 13. Both places allude to ſuch as are beſieged or aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted: hence Converſion is called a turning from Satan unto God, <hi>Act.</hi> 26.21. <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 1.14. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.25, 26. See the manner of Chriſts Conquering fouls, <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.21. <hi>Matt.</hi> 12.29. 1. He binds the ſtrong man, puts ſome reſtraint on Satan; he takes away the power he had to lead the man Captive, does as it were cancel his Commiſſion: Satan cannot come and go as he did; he was wont
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:103420:112"/>to come as a man to his own houſe: Now he <hi>comes as a thief or a robber;</hi> he cannot ſet ſuch a luſt on fire, nor blow up ſuch a Corruption, nor ſend on ſuch an Errand, nor employ the mans Eye, or Ear, or Tongue, or Hand, or Foot as he did, he muſt have Chriſts leave. Now, 2. He ſpoils Satan of his goods: the members of the body, and the faculties of the Soul, Satan made a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe of them in Paradiſe; there they were mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and ſpoiled, and unfitted for Gods uſe, and fit only for Satans: Firſt, Chriſt recovers them to the right owner; he firſt makes them meet for him, and then reſtores them to him; he retrieves the Mind from ignorance, errour, and diabolick light: ſets the Will at liberty from luſts, breaks the refractorineſs of it, and makes it ſweetly yield <hi>in the day of his power,</hi> Pſalm 110.3: and ſo all within and without, are now <hi>yielded as weapons of righteouſneſs unto holineſs.</hi> 3. He takes away his Armour, that wherein Satan truſted: Satan, though he had ſecured his intereſt in the Soul by cuſtomary ſinning, which had ſtrengthned the habit of ſin, and hardned the heart in it, and made the man bold in ſin; Chriſt comes as a Prince, and makes the man tremble: he gives repentance, and breaks the ſtone in the heart. May be, 2. Satan had corrupted mans judgment, and fortified his intereſt with carnal reaſon; when the true light comes, the man ſees himſelf a fool; Or, may be, 3. He has ſtrongly engaged the affections in ſin, and truſted to that: Chriſt diſintangles them. Or, may be, 4. He had fitted them with ſuitable temptations: for, as there is a malignant influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and energy in all Satans temptations, ſo
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:103420:113"/>he uſes to chuſe out ſuitable temptations, from pleaſure perhaps, riches or honour; Chriſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitters theſe, and debaſes them; they loſe their operation. And now having deſtroyed the power of ſin, he deſtroys Satans reign in the Soul: for all the title Satan has to Sinners, is by means of ſin, which is his feed.</p>
            <p>Chriſt had done all this meritoriouſly upon the Croſs, as a publick perſon in the Elects ſtead, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the promiſe in the Text: there he judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and caſt out Satan, <hi>John</hi> 12.31. He was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly judged and caſt out of Heaven; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming head of ſinful men, he is again judged and dethroned by Jeſus Chriſt; ſee this at length, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.13, 14, 15, <hi>He ſpoiled principalities and powers</hi> (in Greek, <hi>ſtript them):</hi> Hence <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.68, <hi>He ſhall divide the ſpoil: he made a ſhew of them openly</hi> (an alluſion unto Conquerors, who for a Trophy uſe to hang up the Armour and Enſigns of their conquered Enemies: ſo that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan was out-witted in putting <hi>Judas on betraying,</hi> and the <hi>Jews on crucifying him, triumphing over them in it: he led Captivity captive:</hi> and as Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors uſed to bind their Captives to their Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots, and lead them in Triumph; ſo did he on the Croſs: and by virtue of this Conqueſt, the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect are preſerved and kept alive, and alſo kept from ſinning irremedileſly, or unto death, before their Converſion; and in due time are actually reſcued from Satan, and ſet againſt him.</p>
            <p>Now we come to the ſecond thing obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, <hi>viz.</hi> That this enmity to God, is not all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved at once: Satans <hi>head is not bruiſed</hi> at firſt, either in his perſon or in his ſeed: he that has
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:103420:113"/>decreed the enmity between the godly and the wicked, hath alſo decreed the enmity between Grace and ſin; what is of Chriſt, and what is of Satan, in the ſame Soul; there's ſomething in the man who is in Chriſt, whereby Satan has acceſs to trouble and moleſt the Soul: he makes the poor Believer go halting, and makes all his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual motions uneaſie and ungrateful; were it not for this, had not Satan ſome part within us, we might laugh at his aſſaults: and were it not for this, the World could not defile us, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.15. It's true, Satan invaded man, and prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when he had no part within him: but he has now further advantages againſt us; we cannot hold him out, though we would, as man might then have done; he has ſome within to open the gates to him; he has a party ſtill in Arms for him within us, a whole <hi>body of ſin</hi> that has many members, and theſe all under the <hi>law of ſin,</hi> and ſtir when ever Satan will, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.23, 24: And O how fierce are the aſſaults of this <hi>body of ſin?</hi> It made <hi>Peter</hi> ſwear againſt Chriſt; It made <hi>Aſa</hi> rage againſt the Prophet; It made fierce diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas:</hi> and there's no reconciling this enmity, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.2, 7; it will not, and cannot be ſufficient, &amp;c. The <hi>old man</hi> may be ſlain and mortified, but will never yield.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 3. That all who ſide with Chriſt, muſt reſolve to maintain enmity and war againſt Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, and that party that Satan has in them. From the day that one is born again, there's a war begun; there's two parties in the man: and there's nothing the one does, but the other op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes; ſo that neither good nor evil can be done
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:103420:114"/>with full conſent, or with the whole Soul: If Satans ſide carry it, Chriſts party diſſents, and proteſts, and bears witneſs againſt it. If any good be ſet about, the <hi>old man</hi> ſhall either make the work to ceaſe, or elſe ſome way marr it. Satan ſhall have his ſoul fingers on every Duty: all who lay claim to Chriſt, are bound to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain this war, and hold up this enmity, and think it a mercy, that God will let you call the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part in you, <hi>you your ſelf;</hi> and the worſt part, but <hi>your fleſh,</hi> Rom. 7.25. <hi>So then with the mind I my ſelf ſerve the law of God, but with the fleſh the law of ſin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſ.</hi> 4. That Satan and indwelling ſin are li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited and bounded; the guilt of ſin ſhall not outlaw the Believer: if the Serpent ſting you, yet your wound ſhall not be deadly. Satan may leave his marks upon you: and indeed, were it not for him who was <hi>lifted up</hi> after the manner of the <hi>brazen Serpent,</hi> every bite of this Serpent were mortal: this remaining inward enmity will be working, and Satan will be ſneaking about your heels, and ſeeking to intangle your affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions (which are as the feet of the Soul): but he can come no higher than your heel; he may darken your light indeed, but it's by corrupting your affections; and when he has done all, he cannot extinguiſh Divine Light. Indwelling ſin may raiſe Sedition, and cauſe much oppoſition and diſturbance to Chriſts Kingdom within, but it ſhall not be able to diſſolve his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſ.</hi> 5. That all who ſide with Chriſt, and maintain this enmity againſt Satan and his ſeed,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:103420:114"/>ſhall in the event be victorious; Chriſt in them ſhall <hi>bruiſe Satans head:</hi> for we muſt not think to hold our own, much leſs to overcome without him. Now concerning this Victory: 1. See that it's no fancy to think that the weakeſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lower of Chriſt that's often foiled, yet ſhall conquer Satan through Chriſt; you ſhall not die of your wounds: you may truſt to this firſt Goſpel-promiſe, that to this day has never fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. 2. That when Satan is doing you moſt harm, and getting moſt advantage againſt you, he is neareſt his overthrow: when he is <hi>bruiſing your heel,</hi> he hazards the cruſhing of his head; this is Chriſts fitteſt way to deſtroy him: thus he makes Temptations work for good, yea, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feats Satan; he makes them ſtrong by their falls: this is a part of the Myſterie of Chriſt, yet is an eſtabliſhed and experienced Truth; he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver let Satan touch your heel, but that thereby he might to the greater glory of his Wiſdom and Grace <hi>bruiſe his head.</hi> 3. Though this be a certain Truth that he will bruiſe Satan, yet has he not told us when, nor what way he will do it; may be not now, nor a month, nor a year hence: may be neither this way, nor any you can think of: It's enough for us to know that it is decreed, and that Gods faithfulneſs is in pledg for it. The day is coming that you ſhall be Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors: and the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>It ſhall ſhortly be,</hi> Rom. 16.20.</p>

               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. You that are out of Chriſt, ſee your miſery: you are on Satans ſide, are ſlaves to him, under chains, curſe, ſervant of ſervants; he has a

Who oppoſes and repels our pleading for Chriſt? who furniſhes you with cavils againſt Chriſt, but he? they are certainly brutiſh that engage in the ſervice of Tyrants, and that kill others, and daily oppoſe their own lives to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the ambition of others; or may be for their bread, or a name among ſuch fools as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: how much more thoſe who to gratifie Satan, war againſt their own ſouls? Oh, is it nothing to you to be under the malignant influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Satan: he has ſome brutiſh pleaſures to entice you, but they are only pleaſant poiſons.</p>

Hereby prove your ſelves; you are either fighting on Chriſts ſide, or againſt him; you cannot be at peace with Satan and Chriſt alſo: What know you of the Conflict between the fleſh and the Spirit? Are you chearful actors in ſin? or are you ſufferers by it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7, beyond what you ever found in any other thing? Or, is there any proteſtation entred in Chriſts behalf, or in behalf of the ſpiritual Law of God? Is the heel or your head bruiſed by Satan? No doubt you find ſomething within you ready to join with what comes from Satan; but do you alſo find any thing within that's ready to comply with what comes from Chriſt, that falls in with Truth and Duties, with the motions and aſſiſtances of his Spirit? Finally, his ſeed and <hi>ſervants you are, whoſe work you do,</hi> Rom. 6.16, 17. Rom. 8.13.</p>
            <pb n="223" facs="tcp:103420:115"/>

You that are in Chriſt, think not to be free of Satans enmity: I ſpeak not now of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies without, but look that he fire not the houſe within; expect an inteſtine War; you have bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, reſtleſs Enemies; Satan can muſter many cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions within: Atheiſm, Pride, Worldlineſs, Senſuality, Unbelief: theſe all ſtand for Satan, and you are in more hazard of them, than all Enemies you have without you, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.14. Then be not ſecure: this had almoſt undone <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;</hi> keep watch and ward, eſpecially when you know that the Enemy is <hi>within you,</hi> and examine all that come and go to and from thy heart, for it's time of War: (There be ſome who at their Converſion are zealous and vigorous in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts with indwelling ſin, who are much in Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and ſtrong cryes, &amp;c. but ſoon abate; and why? not becauſe Satan and ſin are quite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated and expelled, but becauſe they are weary to keep up a continual conflict with themſelves, and therefore at leaſt make a ceſſation of Arms: Satan lets them alone, and they let him alone: they go on ſmoothly in Duties, they find no comfort in them, yet find no trouble: ſin in the heart prevails, yet is not grievous, becauſe not oppoſed, ſo that there needs a new Converſion and a new Conqueſt (ſuch as we have ſpoke of), <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.29.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Hence we ſee how poor weak Creatures come to be victorious, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.36, <hi>through him,</hi> &amp;c. Were it not for Chriſt, he that overcame <hi>Adam</hi> in innocency, would eaſily defeat us. It's not for want of Adverſaries that ſome get to Heaven, and
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:103420:116"/>not others; it's not for want of Temptations: the Angels had not theſe, yet fell; and ſome now have them; and yet periſh not by them. It's not for want of ſin within: Satan had no part in <hi>Adam,</hi> yet overcame him; he has a part in the Believer, yet cannot overcome him. It's not from our willing, or working, or vigorous warring with ſin that we overcome, but it's through him who is the <hi>ſeed of the woman:</hi> yet not as ſuch, or conſidered meerly as a man; ſtrength of inherent Grace ſecured not <hi>Paul,</hi> the aged and experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Soldier of Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.24.25. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.

You that are on Chriſts ſide: be encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, he has already condemned ſin, and undone the condemning-power of it; and if you be his, it is dying in you: indeed he inflicts a lingring death on it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.24. Where it reigns, it kills, therefore he breaks his power at firſt ſtroke: which makes young Converts ſo tender, and ſo ſevere to it in themſelves and others: if at any time it make head, he knocks it down again, yet not wholly; for he manifeſts the ſufficiency of his Grace now more in keeping up the conflict, than in conquering: And you have more cauſe to fear the ſins you are at league with, than thoſe you war with. It's true, the beſt ſide is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times worſted; but it's ſo ordered, that the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs Satan gets, tends to his overthrow, and the Believers Conqueſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.36; for Chriſt will
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:103420:116"/>not loſe his own in the Believer, he never loſes poſſeſſion, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.18, 19. He ſins, yet conſents not: and in time Chriſt turns the Battel, and by little and little carries on a compleat Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory.</p>
            <p>Is not this good news to you that are in Chriſt? Sin may vex you like the <hi>Midianites,</hi> but it ſhall not be your ruin; he has not exempted you from trouble for ſin, nor from war with it: and may be, when one head is cut off, as with <hi>Hydra,</hi> another ſtarts up: yet it ſhall not outlaw you, nor <hi>ſeparate from Chriſt,</hi> nor be gainer in the War, though it may in ſome Battel. What hinders then your joy? is it becauſe you ſee not your ſins lying dead (as the <hi>Iſaelites</hi> ſaw the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians?</hi> for God has promiſed to <hi>caſt them into the bottom of the Sea,</hi> alluding to this, in the Red-ſea of Chriſts blood) and are afraid that one time or other they will undo you? but it ſhall as ſoon fetch Chriſt out of Heaven, as keep any of his ſeed out of it; and ſhall as ſoon bring Chriſt to the Croſs again, as ſend any of them to Hell. It's true, <hi>If you live after the fleſh, you ſhall die,</hi> Rom. 8.13. But it's true alſo, that the Believer cannot live in it; <hi>for how can we that are dead to ſin, live in it?</hi> Rom. 6.2.</p>
            <p>Now, may be ſome will ſay, It's indeed good news, that God has promiſed a Deliverer; that in the <hi>Volume,</hi> or in the <hi>Head, Beginning</hi> (for ſo the word ſignifies) <hi>of the book it is written of him,</hi> Pſalm 40.7: (which ſome think relates to that firſt Promiſe). And it's good to hear that Chriſt ſhall ſubdue and defeat Satan and ſin: But what is that to me? how ſhall the unworthy apply
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:103420:117"/>this Promiſe? Now to obviate exceptions of this nature, there are ſeveral things conſiderable in the firſt circumſtances of the Promiſe, which may meet with your caſe: 1. The Promiſe was made to as ſinful Creatures as ever were any; To <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Evah,</hi> who ſinned againſt the greateſt Light, the greateſt Obligations and Favours, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the faireſt warning; who ſinned moſt hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouſly againſt firſt and ſecond Table; who ſinned with a deſign to dethrone God, and make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves like to him, to the overthrow and ruin of their poſterity: and all this by the motion of Gods greateſt Enemy, and that in the appearance of a creeping beaſt, which bid <hi>eat</hi> that which God had <hi>forbidden;</hi> a ſin which all mankind may be aſhamed of; yet notwithſtanding all this, they have this promiſe made by the Lords own mouth to them. 2. It was made when no means were eſſayed, in order to the obtaining of it; it never came in their heart to cry for mercy; but when they were running away, then did theſe good tidings overtake them: then thou who art beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging for mercy, may hope for it. If you ſay, you are not uſing means for it: I would not encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage the neglect of them; yet would not lay too much ſtreſs upon them: they did not reject the Promiſe upon ſuch an account: it's but a tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to think thou cannot make uſe of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe; art thou content of all the parts of it, to war with Satan and Sin, as well as to have a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer to fight and conquer for thee? If thou like Chriſt, and be ſatisfied to be on his ſide, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it will belong to thee: thou muſt be of one of thoſe two ſides. Now, which like you
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:103420:117"/>beſt? 2. This promiſe is made, as to great Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, ſo to ſuch as were as little ſenſible of ſin as could be: there was no kindly ſenſe nor heart-breaking for it: they hid themſelves for fear and ſhame: yet when arraigned and accuſed for ſin, they will not take with it; <hi>Adam</hi> turns it partly over on God, and partly on his Wife: ſhe turns it over on the Serpent; were they like to have ſuch a promiſe made to them? then let no poor Soul be diſcouraged for little ſenſe of ſin; ſeek it, but be not troubled about the meaſure of it; we muſt preach Chriſt and Free grace to all: may be, a Goſpel-poomiſe will work that ſenſe of ſin, which otherwiſe thou cannot get. To conclude then, If you have need of this Promiſe, take it; but be ſure you take it all together, that you ſide with Chriſt, and war againſt Satan, and know, that the words have alſo the force of a Command, and that to the whole Church, to all that hear the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe; for ſo the expreſſion imports, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.3, 4, 5.</p>
            <p>Now let us in the next place ſpeak to the words, as they relate to mans outward ſtate; and concerning this, let us lay down ſome Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinal Truths from them:</p>
            <p n="1">1. That there is a decreed and ſtated Enmity between Satan and his followers on the one ſide, and Chriſt and his followers on the other: Now, 1. For the parties; Satan he is the head of thoſe that oppoſe Chriſt and his Ided, he is always ſpoke of as the party, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.7, who the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon is, ſee <hi>ver.</hi> 9. <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.13, <hi>The Dragon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted the woman,</hi> &amp;c. So <hi>ver.</hi> 17; Others do but war under him: they derive their malignity and enmity from him, and have as it were their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:103420:118"/>from him, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.2, <hi>The Dragon gave his power, his ſeat, and authority unto the Beaſt:</hi> that is, to <hi>Antichriſt;</hi> Satan had his ſeat there before, and the idolatrous Heathen perſecuting Emperors were his great Vaſſals and Deputies. Now thoſe failing him; he gives his power to the Pope, and he becomes the Devils great Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant. Inferior perſecuting Princes and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates are either Antichriſts underlings, or they have their power from Satan the ſame way that Antichriſt has. If you ſay, <hi>Are not all powers of God,</hi> Rom. 13.1? And what power has Satan to give? I anſwer. No doubt the Antichriſtian powers is from God as a puniſhment to the World, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.10: yet it is from Satan. If we conſider the nature of it, the very Office it ſelf of Popes and Prelates being contrary to the word of God, or the things wherein he arroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth power. And alſo, if we conſider the way of his coming by it, and his blaſphemous and tyrannical manner in exerciſing it, of all which Satan is the Author, as he is of all the exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances of every Government that are to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of the godly; hence, as the worſhippers of Antichriſt are ſaid to <hi>worſhip the Dragon, who gave power unto the Beaſt,</hi> Rev. 13.4: ſo the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers and admirers of any wicked Conſtitution in Church or State, or any power that is levelled againſt Chriſt and his feed, do in ſo far own Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan the God of this World; and in ſo far declare themſelves to be on his ſide, and joyn iſſue with him.</p>
            <p>If any object, the horror and hatred men have naturally at the Devil, how then came they to
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:103420:118"/>be on his ſide? I Anſwer, Whatever hatred na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural men have to the Devil, and horror they conceive at his appearance, as a Creature of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Order, and as a powerful Spirit, repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed alſo as malicious and envious at the good of mankind; yet it's clear, that they conſpire in their enmity to God, and Chriſt, and his ſeed: There's a fundamental friendſhip with him, even when they are bleſſing themſelves from him, and ſpeaking againſt him, even as there is a radical enmity in Sinners to God; though Cuſtom or E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation has taught them to ſpeak well of him. Satan is the god of this World; and though he be a Tyrant, and keep Sinners in bondage, and ruleth them at his pleaſure, yet ſometimes he perſonates a ſervant to them: and ordinarily em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploys them in ſuch work as is ſuitable to their corrupted nature, and takes ſuch ways with them as are pleaſing to the fleſh; ſo that there needeth no force to keep them in ſervitude: they are ſo well-pleaſed with their Lord, that his fetters are as Gold-chains to them; yea, ſome of them are ſo far transformed into the ſpirit and image of the Devil, as to commit ſuch prodigious acts of wickedneſs, that one would think humane Nature corrupted as it is, ſhould tremble at it: and, in nothing has this appeared more than in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of this Enmity in thoſe horrid and dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical methods, and arts of violence and cruelty, that have almoſt in all Ages been invented and uſed againſt the godly; and as for that Dread men commonly have at his appearance, it is known how eaſily they are familiarized; yea, he has taught men to call evil Spirits, Familiars, good
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:103420:119"/>Neighbours, &amp;c. And how many are in expreſs Covenant with him? There's no man can deny this, but with the ſame breath he denies Chriſt, the Scriptures, and experience (it is credibly reported of 17 Popes, one after another): And in moſt, if not all places of the World he has been, and in many yet is viſibly worſhipped, and hath a Neighbourhood, or rather a viſible Kingdom a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Againſt whom, and what is this enmity of Satan and his ſeed levelled? I Anſwer, Prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily againſt God; he is an Adverſary to God and holineſs, and ſo to Jeſus Chriſt as God, and alſo as man; becauſe he had ſo much of God in him, more than any man: and to the Saints, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their relation to God and Chriſt: his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to God appears in his whole deſign and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs: more particularly in his blaſphemous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections into the minds of poor Creatures, and in his uſing the tongues of ſome that he poſſeſſes, to blaſpheme God; and indeed, his enticing of men to war againſt Heaven with their tongues, in curſing and blaſphemous Oaths, where there is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther profit nor pleaſure to allure them, is a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient evidence, both of the Devils and of mans enmity to God. 2. This is levelled againſt Jeſus Chriſt; how early ſtirred he up perſecution a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him as ſoon as he was born, and did all he could againſt him? and ſuch enmity has he to his Name, and to the very ſhadow of Chriſtianity, that he will admit none unto a ſtrict conſederacy with him, till they have renounced Chriſt, and the ſign of their dedication to him. And Oh, what an aſtoniſhing meditation is it, to think that Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:103420:119"/>once ſo holy and wiſe, ſhould have fallen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuch deeps of ſin, or riſen into ſuch a height of indignation againſt infinite holineſs and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that now their only ſcope and delight ſhould be to diſhonour God, and to mar his work in the World, and his Image in man! And what an aſtoniſhing witneſs is this of the patience of God! we wonder he bears ſo long with men that are Veſſels of wrath, who are but like graſs on the houſe-tops: whereas he has ſuffered Satan for ſeveral thouſand years, to range and tyrannize up and down the World, and yet this mars not the luſtre and beauty of Gods wiſe Government of the World. 3. This Enmity is alſo levelled againſt the followers of Chriſt: all the actings of evil ſpirits in the World have a tendency to mens hurt (whatever friendſhip they may pretend): and it is not any outward concern of mens, that they eſpecially intend to ruin, and are at pain and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to undo; It is the great and eternal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern of their immortal Souls that they level at; they envy them that happineſs which they are out of hope of; or their hatred to God and Chriſt is heightned from their paſſing by them, when they choſe and redeemed ſome of loſt men. Now, as the Lord deſigns his peoples good, by all the ſeeming contrary dealings with them; ſo does the Devil by his contrary methods intend to hurt them: whether he tempt, or forbear to tempt; whether he ſolicite <hi>Peter</hi> to hinder Chriſts ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, or prompts <hi>Judas</hi> to further them: when he ſeems aſleep, and when he rages, there's as much enmity in his peace, as in his war; If he keep truce with ſuch as are explicitely or impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citely
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:103420:120"/>in Covenant with him, it's but for a while. Now this Enmity is chiefly againſt the Church or Churches, where he can get a true viſible Church, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.13. It's with the Woman; where we ſee alſo that Gods ſpecial preſervation of his Church, and diſappointing or fruſtrating helliſh deſigns againſt a Church, does greatly gall Satan, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſperate him againſt them; when the <hi>Dragon</hi> ſaw that he was caſt down to the earth, he <hi>perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the woman,</hi> &amp;c. And <hi>ver.</hi> 17, <hi>The Dragon was wrath with the woman,</hi> the earth having helped her (ſometimes God makes carnal men helpful to his Church, and reſtrains their Enmity). Why? the Woman had done him no wrong, was only eſcaped: and this diabolick diſpoſition, we may clearly ſee in his ſeed: there's nothing pains ſome ſo much, as that they cannot do miſchief to the people of God. Do we not ſee ſome acted with fury and unſatiable cruelty againſt the people of God, without the leaſt provocation, beyond what men expreſs in other caſes, and beyond what mens natural enmity to Truth and Holineſs does ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily carry them? even ſuch fury as diſcovers ſome violent excitement from Hell, and carries a lively reſemblance of the Devil? Now, <hi>ver.</hi> 17. We ſee alſo, that when Satan cannot find a viſible pure conſtituted Church, then he bends his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice againſt ſingle Profeſſors, that keep themſelves pure from the corruption of the place they live in, they are there called <hi>the womans ſeed:</hi> he <hi>went to make war with the remnant of her ſeed.</hi> The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of theſe are worth our obſerving, <hi>ver.</hi> 17; they are ſuch as <hi>keep the Commandments of God:</hi> that is meant in oppoſition to thoſe whoſe
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:103420:120"/>Religion lies moſt in obedience to Cuſtoms, Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions and <hi>Commandments of men,</hi> whereby they make void the Inſtitutions and Commands of God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They are ſuch as have the <hi>Teſtimony of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus;</hi> that is, that bear Teſtimony to him in all his Offices, in oppoſition to thoſe, who by their Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, Humane ſatisfactions and ſelf-righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>deny Chriſt to be come in the fleſh;</hi> and alſo to thoſe who deny, or incroach upon any of his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices: Theſe two contain much of the diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing Characters of the true Church, and true members of Jeſus Chriſt, from the falſe.</p>
            <p n="3">3. As for the Nature and properties of this Enmity between the two ſeeds: 1. It's for no private particular quarrels; Oh, what a bitter Antipathy do men manifeſt, even to thoſe from whom they never received any perſonal injury; their own hearts muſt tell them, that it can be from nothing but the appearance of the Image of God in them; their pretending to hate their Hypocriſie, is vain. For 1. Under this pretence, Chriſt and the godly of old were perſecuted, 2. Why do they not hate the openly prophane, who yet call themſelves <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and are angry when denied outward priviledges, and the Seals of Chriſtianity. 3. How comes it that the holieſt and ſincereſt are moſt hated? and that the looſer any Profeſſor be, he has the more favour from them: let them run with them to the ſame exceſs of Riot, and they can be one with them; let them but ſee you have no more Religion than they have, and you may gain their friendſhip. Some pretend their diſconformity to
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:103420:121"/>the publick Laws; and indeed, on this founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were all the perſecutions, almoſt of former times bottomed; the wiſer Heathens even in the Primitive times brought it to this. But 1. Whence is it that Laws comes to be enacted and levelled againſt the godly? What diſturbance does the purity of Religion create to the publick peace? Is there no prejudice to the publick by Comedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and Stage-players? and is there ſo much from Miniſters preaching Jeſus Chriſt? Are Meetings for the worſhip of God the only dangerous Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, when yet our Adverſaries do not ſo much as pretend that there is any thing in our Worſhip contrary to the Scriptures? 2. Whence is it that everywhere theſe Laws that are level<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led againſt Chriſt and his followers, are with more care and ſeverity executed than other laws? yea, than laws againſt ſuch things and perſons that are apparently dangerous to the Publick? whence is it that ordinarily men outdo in the one, and come ſhort of the Law in other caſes?</p>
            <p n="2">2. This Enmity is univerſal; in all the <hi>ſeed of the Serpent,</hi> againſt all the <hi>ſeed of Chriſt:</hi> it is not lately taken up, but has ſhewed it ſelf in all the Ages of the World, and in every place where Chriſtianity has been, or is known. Parents tranſmit it to their Poſterity, and the Children ſhew themſelves heirs to it, and conſequently to all the effects of it, from, <hi>Cain,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.35. And is it not apparent that the calmeſt of them, and ſuch as have been much poliſhed and civilized by Religion, yet have a bitter prejudice and ſecret working of heart againſt the power of it, and will upon occaſions break forth in rage
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:103420:121"/>againſt it where it appears; there wants not clear evidences of this, even in the moſt calm and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able diſpoſitions, and ſuch in whom this enmity is moſt reſtrained, and who profeſs great friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and favour to Chriſt and his followers, yet cannot endure the ſhining and condemning-Light that's in the truly godly: but reproach, cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and hate them, for having that which them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves would be thought to have, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.1, 3: Yea, ſuch is this Enmity, that let the godly be never ſo quiet and peaceable, and uſeful in the Societies they live in, it is never the leſs: yea, ſuch is it, that no natural Bond nor Relation can extinguiſh it: no Friendſhip, and no Bond in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſo firm, but it can break and diſſolve. No ſooner gets Chriſt a little footing in a Family, or Town, or Village, but there's diſcords and jar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings: Satan and his party takes the Alarm; as ſoon as any thing of Chriſt appears in one, <hi>he is as a ſign and a wonder to a prophane generation:</hi> the World is like a Stepmother, and neareſt Friends change their countenance.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This is an irreconcileable Enmity; this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie could never be taken up nor compoſed; the hatred is ſo rooted, that the wiſeſt and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Reconcilers and Peace-makers, could never yet unite theſe two parties, no more than they can alter mens Natures. It's folly to think or talk of reconciling them; this Decree of Heaven is ſtronger than the Decree of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians:</hi> Men may talk of Accommodations, and Comprehenſions, and Condeſcenſions: they may talk of prudence and moderation, and mutual for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance, and diſpenſing with ſome things for peace-ſake;
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:103420:122"/>But can light and darkneſs, can Heaven and Hell agree? There may be healing methods found out for uniting the godly, when differing in ſome particulars; their having one ſpirit and new Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is a good foundation for agreement: but for the unſanctified, the godly differ from them, not ſo much in opinions and outward practice, as in their ſpirit; ſo that though they ſhould unite ſo far, as to profeſs the ſame truths, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God in the ſame outward manner; were there never ſo much uniformity in theſe things, yet can they never ſement, nor come to the kindly union of ſpirit.</p>
            <p>And all this we may ſee in our day, this En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity was never more manifeſt: there's a party driving Satans deſign; there be various forms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them; but all conſpire againſt the truly godly, as <hi>Edom, Ammon</hi> and <hi>Amalek:</hi> and there is a party that maintain Chriſts cauſe, that keep the <hi>Commandments of God,</hi> and have the <hi>Teſtimony of Jeſus,</hi> though under divers denominations al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo; and that the others quarrel with them, is meerly from the old Enmity, were eaſie to make out. It is manifeſt, that whatever different no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions men have of forms of Worſhip and Church-diſcipline, yet the matter lies not there; for how unlike are they to many godly perſons of the former generation, and to ſome yet in outward Communion with them, who profeſſed the ſame principles? And what a kindly ſympathy and warm ſide have they to the prophane, and to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, from whom they would ſeem in their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples to differ more than from us. Oh, ſee here your temper and ſtate by Nature, and bleſs God
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:103420:122"/>if he has ſlain this enmity to Chriſt, and brought you over to his ſide.</p>
            <p>What remains in the Text, I ſhall in a few words abſolve. 2. Then obſerve, That as the Lord had decreed this Enmity, ſo he has decreed that Satan ſhall vex Chriſt and his followers, he ſhall <hi>bruiſe their heel:</hi> think not to get to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven without ſome hurt, or ſomething that will make thee halt; reckon upon it, to bear the mark of Satan and his ſeeds malice.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 3. That God has bounded the vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that Satan and his party ſhall give to the godly. Fear no great hurt from them, their wound is not deadly, it comes not near their heart: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, they are ſaid <hi>to make war with the Saints, and overcome them,</hi> Rev. 13.7: but that's only in their outward concerns, and over their bodily lives; the Lord would not have you to think much even of that, but count temporal death as a hurt only in the <hi>heel:</hi> compare that with <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.11. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.37. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 44.17, 18, 19, 20; ſee the worſt Satan and his party can do, you are above them: if they bite your <hi>heel,</hi> it's no great damage.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 4. That Chriſt and all that ſide with him, ſhall certainly be victorious. Satans head, and the head of all his followers ſhall be <hi>bruiſed:</hi> as ſure as they now hurt your <hi>heel,</hi> their <hi>head</hi> ſhall be <hi>bruiſed.</hi> Think on this, you who are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to ſay, That it's but folly to eſſay to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the ſpite of the time, and therefore would either yield when tryals are ſharp, or would be at compoſing matters, and complying a little with Satans party, for it's certainly decreed, that they ſhall loſe the day: and that Chriſt and his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:103420:123"/>ſhall be the laſt in the Field; and who will join with a party that are ſure will be broke, whatever ſucceſs they may ſeem to have for a while? Let this help your faith; ſhall Satan and his party prevail? ſhall they extinguiſh the light of the Goſpel, or hinder the progreſs of it? ſhall they pluck the ſtars of the Churches out of Chriſts hands? any, no more than they can hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Sun to riſe, or the Moon from giving its light, or the Sea to flow: then fear not <hi>Papists,</hi> or Prelates that ſhall die, and wither like the graſs. <hi>Antichriſt</hi> and all his party, they are now ripen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faſt, and are like fuel drying for the fire. <hi>Tophet is prepared of old</hi> for them: yet a little while and they ſhall blaze and flame, the Breath of the Lord like a River of Brimſtone ſhall kindle them; their Enmity is chiefly levelled againſt Chriſt, and it's againſt the godly for his ſake; and you doubt not but he is able to conquer Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan; and ſhall not the Saints ſhare in his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt? You need not doubt of Satans overthrow, ſince Chriſt is his chief party.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 5. That the moſt compendious way for Satan and his parties ruin, is their attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting againſt Chriſt and his followers, the biting of their <hi>heel:</hi> when they are doing moſt miſchief, they are neareſt his ſtroke, they are now with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his reach: this was clear in Chriſts ſufferings, wherein Satan and his party were active, <hi>by his death he ſlew him that had the power of death,</hi> he ſet his foot on the Serpents neck: when they bite his <hi>heel,</hi> he will ſtrike out their teeth, hee'l trample on them with his feet of braſs, and break them with his Mace of Iron like a Potters-Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel:
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:103420:123"/>when you ſee the Serpent buſieſt, biting the <hi>heel</hi> of the godly, you may ſay, now God is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to ſet his foot on the neck of his Enemies: he takes the ſhorteſt and the wiſeſt way to ruin them.</p>

               <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 6. From the time that this Promiſe of the Enemies overthrow was given to the Church, that deliverance waits not for our good frame. <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Evah</hi> were lying ſecurely in ſin without ſenſe of it, unwilling to take with it, uſing no diligence for their relief; there's little regret for ſin amongſt us, and ſmall appearance of the ruin of the Churches Adverſaries; yet, who knows how ſoon the vengeance of the Temple may overtake them? That Promiſe could not be but a perfect ſurpriſal, and ſo is ordinarily the accompliſhment of it alſo: both as to the ſpiritual Salvation intended in it, and as to the outward deliverance of the Church that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains.</p>

If you will not debate with Satan and his party, and fight under Chriſt, then think not to get any good by Chriſt. You ſee the Terms then, clauſe you which of them.</p>
